Wall of Inequality, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/use-this-wp-template-4.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><strong><em>We live in times where: GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is measured in tons; Citizen Rights in Volts; Nationalism in Decibels; Poverty in Heights and length of Wall.</em></strong></p><p>As the US President visited India on 24<sup>th</sup> of February; the Indian government had spent more than hundred crore rupees for his welcome and on the other side Trump imposed the $260 million-dollar penalty on India and also excluded India form the developing category list. This move not only resulted in a loss of to $260 million in GDP benefits; but also about how many lakhs jobs could be lost in specific industries when the economy is facing unemployment and stagflation. It is also suggested that no big trade deal negotiations took place during his visit.</p><p>The land of Mahatma Gandhi i.e. Gujarat where the president arrived on 24th February on a two-day trip and covered Ahmedabad; New Delhi and Agra as well. Indian government called this trip as &#x201C;<strong><em>Namaste Trump</em></strong>&#x201D;.</p><p></p><p>For both leaders; Trump and Modi; it was a welcome distraction. Mr. Trump was eager to change the subject after his impeachment trial; and Mr. Modi loved a reprieve from growing protest scenarios over a new anti-secular; discriminatory and anti-Muslim Citizenship Law.</p><p><strong>Ahmedabad visit</strong></p><p>Donald Trump inaugurated world&#x2019;s largest cricket stadium; Motera Stadium; situated in Ahmedabad. The Indian government had set a budget of over one hundred crore rupees for a three-hour visit. A wall was constructed by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation in a bid to mask a slum area situated between the stadium and the airport. These areas had seen a little to no development in the past years.</p><p>Instead of providing basic facilities like food; clothes; education; water and proper drainage system to the slum population; around 45 families got the eviction notices by the government.</p><p>In 2014; President of China Xi Jinping visited New Delhi and the same steps were taken by the Indian government to hide the Indian poverty with the help of green shaded net.</p><p>During Delhi assembly election 2020; Modi government promised to provide 20 lakhs homes with the slogan &#x201C;Jahan<strong><em> Jhuggi Wahi Makaan</em></strong>&#x201D; but now the same government builds a literal wall between rich and poor people of the country.</p><p></p><p>Is the construction of the walls justified?</p><p>Two third or approximately 68.8 percent of the Indian population lives in poverty. According to 2011 census Gujarat poverty rate is 16.63 per 1 million people but the government is busy in building walls which costs over hundreds crore rupees.</p><p>Currently; more than 6 crore slum areas are present in India and the people of those areas do not have basic facilities like water; proper drainage system; health and education.</p><p><strong><em>Walls should be built for the homeless not to hide the homeless.</em></strong></p><p>Is there any violation of rights of the people residing in those slums?</p><p>A welfare state is a concept where the state plays a key role in the protection and promotion of economic and social well-being of its citizens. It is based on the principle of equality of opportunity; equitable distribution of wealth and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal necessities for a good life. It is the duty of the government to provide basic needs like education; housing; healthcare; pension and unemployment insurance to its citizens.</p><p><strong>Agra visit</strong></p><p>After the inauguration of the stadium Trump arrived in Agra to see the Taj Mahal. The Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department had released 500 cusecs of water into the Yamuna river in Agra in order to mask its foul smell and stagnant water. In 2017; Agra witnessed very scattered rainfall which almost resulted in a situation of drought. In 2019 about 42% of India&#x2019;s land area had faced drought in different states of the country but at that time government had not taken any strong step for the drought affected areas.</p><p>I think Trump should live in India for a month. If for three hours visit the government can implement so many developmental activities; then what will happen if Trump will stay in India for a month.</p><p></p>", <strong>Md.

Religion: Good Cop; Bad Cop, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/copy-of-use-this-wp-template.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>As we have moved towards a new decade; it is high time to introspect the spiritual thread binding the people with other worldly power. Is it just an overused concept for fear or is it any good?</em></p><p class=""has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size""><strong>A DEATH OF CHOICE</strong>*</p><p>What is a religion? The true definition of religion differs from people to people and therefore to define religion within a few words would be really difficult. However; Oxford Dictionary defines religion as the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power; especially a personal God or gods. There are 19 religions as per the data estimated in 2019 by Adherents.com with Christianity still being the most dominant religion in the world; followed by Islam at the second pedestal and Secular/Nonreligious/Agnostic/Atheist at the third pedestal.</p><p>There are estimated 1.2 billion people who come into the category of Secular/Nonreligious/Agnostic/Atheist and make up about 13.91% of the total world population. The idea of not being a practicing believer and to downright deny any existence of a superpower controlling the world is getting more and more popular as the world moves more and more into the advanced age. Atheistic values within people are on a constant rise; especially in the Generation Z as they get more and more into the science behind the existence of humanity as opposed to Generation X and Generation Y who rather took to Holy Books and believed whatever was written within it about the existence of humanity and the world.</p><p>Estonia has the world&#x2019;s high population of agnostics and atheists; about 77%; and Estonia ranks first in a lot more things like unrestricted access to online services; availability of government/administrative services; family life; tech-savvy environment; etcetera. Estonia ranks 1<sup>st</sup> out of 68 countries when it comes to the best and worst countries to live a connected life; according to Digital Life Abroad Report. The country with the most atheists/agnostics living in is also the country which is most technologically advanced and also the country with the best family life.</p><p>The point of this article is to shed light on the necessity of religion in a person&#x2019;s life; especially in a child&#x2019;s life. Parental religiosity can be a mixed blessing that produces significant gains in social psychological development while potentially undermining academic performance. Religion; upon children; is associated as an obligation rather than love and personal dedication. A child is forced to go and derive meaning from a religious service even though the child itself is too young to even see a meaning in these services.</p><p>Unitarian Universalism is a faith with no conversion rituals and no exclusions by society if a member converts to a different faith. Religious education is not centered on scripture but discussion of ethics and community. Such a faith should be a model to every other religion to look up to. If parents want to raise children who meaningfully practice their religion; the children must accept the faith themselves. Faith and blind fellowship are not the same thing. Forcing a religion on a child not only makes the child hateful towards the parents but also towards the faith that is being forced upon. Nothing in history has ever worked through the means of force without having severe circumstances. A shift from saying; &#x201C;You believe in this&#x201D; towards &#x201C;We believe in this; what do you believe in?&#x201D; is a must requirement for every parent of this new generation.</p><p>The irony behind removing free will from a child after it is born is astonishing. To say they have free will but live in fear of their religion; their God; their holy book; their faith; their beliefs is hypocritical. Indoctrination into religion is done on the basis that a child doesn&#x2019;t have the mental capacity to choose for themselves and so the choice must be made by the parents and that IF the child could choose; they would choose God is also downright bullshit. Such an indoctrination should be considered abuse and should be considered against the basic Human Rights.</p><p></p><p class=""has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size""><strong>A FORUM FOR GROWTH</strong>**</p><p>&#x201C;Religion&#x201D; is a double-edged sword. Since times immemorial; it has been used to make way for peace; as it has been used to reason immoral conducts. With &#x2018;Atheism&#x2019; on rise; the word religion is being scrutinized and its relevance is being questioned. However; there are some aspects that one never really noticed; but sans religion; the absence of these things will have a significant impact.</p><p>Firstly; religiosity has been associated positively with behaviors that help or benefit others; such as volunteering or donating financially. Most religions stress the importance for concern for others and in a way; preach pro-social behavior. This can be countered by the fact that charitable and social nature can be practiced by non-religious people as well. However; there is no obligation in this case; it is completely out of their own will. Thus; when charity becomes an obligation; it affects those in need and instills a sense of morality in the person&#x2019;s attitude; which is etched there for life; especially children.</p><p>All children develop a sense of wonder and curiosity while growing up which leads them to derive meanings from the world around them; including the natural environment. As these innate sensibilities develop; religion often comes in and influences the social and cultural practices of them. The mosque; church; temple or any other religious place often provides children the first point of contact with the community beyond their immediate touch and introduces them to wider social institutions. Here; they learn not only about the religion they are introduced to; but also the moral responsibilities; social behavior; and also their own value as a human being.</p><p>The reason why many parents believe that raising kids with some measure of religion is the best way to teach them how to behave ethically is because religion provides an incentive for them to treat each other well; and act morally &#x2013; lest being punished by a superior power. However; there is a limitation to the thought that religion is the sole reason for moral growth in a person. These things come from their own; religion only gives it the necessary nudge required to frame the impressionable minds of children.</p><p>Nevertheless; religion can have a profound influence on the lifestyle of a person. Lower rates of depression; better sleep quality; greater rate of life satisfaction; lesser use of drugs; alcohol and tobacco; are just some of the well documented benefits associated with personal religiousness. Children who are raised with religious or spiritual beliefs tend to have a better mental health into adulthood; said a new study from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public health found. Religion has given many absolutes which can be arguably good or bad; but it has also given a sense of connection. It cannot be denied that religion has a long history of endorsing cooperation among each other; it has significantly contributed to family relationships; and has also helped young adults/adolescents to successfully navigate life challenges and also bring about many positive health effects and well-being outcomes.</p><p>Lastly; it cannot be denied that; for long; religion has provided the framework for cultural experimentation; which has led to so many milestones that humankind has achieved. It has kept alive the global <em>mosaic </em>culture. Religion is the ground level boot camp; which instills virtues and morals that are only and only beneficial for one&#x2019;s personality. However; with maturity comes manipulation according to one&#x2019;s own whims and fancies and thereby we have the meaning of the word religion in today&#x2019;s context.</p><p></p>", <strong>Nuzhat Khan** &amp; Yusuf Aziz*<br>&#x2013; BA Hons.

Gargi Sexual Harassment Incident – A Report, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/use-this-wp-template-3.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1, <p>On 6th February; Gargi college of Delhi University celebrated the last day of their annual fest &#x2018;Reverie 2020&#x2019; which witnessed enthusiastic attendance by students of Gargi; different colleges of Delhi University and outsiders provided the carried the necessary entry passes. Despite being an event full of several amusing activities; food stalls; fun rides and musical performances; towards the end of the day; the fest&#x2019;s glory &#xA0;took a downfall and became a traumatic memory for many as the fest was hijacked by hordes of unidentified men.The crowd started to build by 4 pm. By 6.30 pm; the main gate was opened and all the men standing among the gathered crowd outside made their way into the venue unchecked. Several middle-aged men also climbed the walls of the college to gain entry.</p><p>Students observed men smoking weed inside the campus; molesting and groping college girls; passing lewd comments and masturbating at them. By the end of the day; the number of men exceeded the number of women present by a large margin and the place became so overcrowded; it became difficult for the students to breathe and several reported having panic attacks. When the students complained to the admin about these incidents; the principal told them to not attend the fest if they felt so unsafe.</p><p>Even though the CRPF and the Delhi Police personnel were deployed in campus; several students allege that they were useless in curbing the mayhem and chaos and neither were the college authorities or union bodies of much assistance.</p><p>On Monday; several students came out to protest against the mishappening and demanded the immediate resignation of the Principal as well as the head of the student union. On 10<sup>th</sup>&#xA0;Feb; an FIR was registered against the intruders accused of harassment by the students of Gargi.</p><p>While the protests in the college continued; ten people were arrested on Wednesday in connection with the events of 6<sup>th</sup>&#xA0;Feb.&#xA0;The Delhi Police has assured the students that many people are being questioned and multiple suspects have been identified from that day. Students of Gargi College have been boycotting classes and are now demanding that the fact finding committee constituted following the incident show its findings.</p><p>They also expressed anger against the college&#x2019;s lax response to the incident and the moral-policing tone that Gargi authorities took after students complained of harassment at the fest. Currently a Saket court granted bail to all the 10 accused of the sexual molestation of students during the cultural festival at Gargi College; on a bail amount of Rs 10;000 each.</p>, <strong>Zainab Wahab</strong><br><strong>B.A. (Hons) English; Jamia Millia Islamia</strong>, Normal, 15/02/2020 
BACKDOOR FOR ISLAMIST EXTREMISM, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/copy-of-use-this-wp-template.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1, <p><strong><em>Shashi Tharoor </em></strong><em>and <strong>Sadanand Dhume </strong>are not bigots and anti-Islam; instead they are sensible liberals who know how to stand in this fight for secularism unlike the woke-Indian-Muslim-liberals who have to resolve to using slogans like &#x2018;La ilaha ilallah&#x2019; and &#x2018;Allahu Akbar&#x2019; to show their <strong>&#x2018;support&#x2019; </strong>for secularism.</em></p><p>All of India came out of its slumber in order to raise their voices against the recently passed bill; now an Act; <strong>Citizenship Amendment Act; 2019</strong>. The protests have been led mainly by Indian Muslims; and they have become the backbone of these protests throughout the country after the dark night of <strong>December 15<sup>th</sup></strong> and the horrific acts of Delhi Police in and around the campus of <strong>Jamia Millia Islamia</strong>. The whole of country opened their eyes and came out on the streets to protest against this unfair and unjust Act in order to get it withdrawn and/or amended.</p><p>After <strong>Delhi Police</strong> showed its true colors in Jamia on December 15<sup>th</sup>; the whole of country stood with Jamia and condemned the acts of Delhi Police. <strong>AMU</strong> and <strong>JNU</strong>; both followed Jamia with their own protests against Delhi Police and also against the very agenda on the table; i.e.; <strong>CAA</strong> and <strong>NRC</strong>. But Jamia wasn&#x2019;t the only one to get the full brunt of the officials of Government. AMU was also stormed by the UP Police and soon the varsity was under heavy attack. Undoubtedly; December 15<sup>th</sup> was a very dark night for both Jamia and AMU. Soon protests began happening all over the country and even outside India to show support for Jamia and AMU and to condemn the actions of the Government.</p><p>The protests against CAA and NRC are still going on throughout the country with Delhi being the one in the center and the heart of these protests. Protest in <strong>Shaheen Bagh</strong> is led mainly by Muslim women who have come out on the street to fight for their <em>identity </em>as an Indian and are protesting day and night. Alongside; protests outside Jamia are still continuing with full intensity and now even the <strong>Jamia Administration</strong> stands with them. Many esteemed personalities have also come to Jamia protests in order to show their own support to the cause.</p><p>However; there are some issues in these protests against CAA and NRC that will benefit the <strong>Bharatiya Janata Party</strong> and their agendas. The communal divide that these issues are creating will benefit BJP and <strong>RSS</strong> who most certainly thrive on communal animosity. As <strong>Hayaat Fatemah</strong> states in her article on <strong>The Indian Express</strong>; <em>&#x201C;&#x2026; the citizenship of a Muslim is questioned; not [their] religious identity.&#x201D; </em>&#xA0;Since CAA questions the citizenship of a Muslim in India and not their religious identity; slogans like <strong><em>&#x201C;La ilaha ilallah&#x201D;</em></strong>and <strong><em>&#x201C;Allahu Akbar&#x201D;</em></strong>will never and has never helped Muslims in any movement. This protest against CAA and NRC that started from Jamia has become a nationwide movement and should not take the shape of an all-Muslim movement because there are people of other religions protesting with Muslims against this unjust Act.</p><p>Recently; <strong>Shashi Tharoor</strong> had visited Jamia to show his support in his stand against CAA and NRC and was met with chants of <strong><em>&#x2018;la ilaha ilallah&#x2019;</em></strong>which caused him to take to <strong>Twitter</strong> to express his concern towards this fight against <strong>Hindutva extremism</strong>. He stated; <em>&#x201C;Our fight against Hindutva extremism should give no comfort to <strong>Islamist extremism</strong> either.&#x201D; </em>But he was met with heavy backlash by <em>&#x201C;woke&#x201D;</em> Indian Muslim liberals who were raising nonsensical arguments like; <em>&#x201C;People in this country say <strong>&#x2018;jai bajrang bali&#x2019;</strong> even before lifting a heavy rock and no one calls it communal. Muslims are pushed to the wall today. Using religious slogans for keeping spirits high is ok when demands are secular. Please spare us this soft bigotry.&#x201D; </em>What these liberals cannot understand is that this fight against CAA and NRC is only about the citizenship of Muslims in India and not about their religious identity. These slogans; which when translated are: <strong>There is no God but Allah</strong>; not only incite a communal divide within the protests but also raise concerns of religious extremism entering the protests through a backdoor.</p><p>These protests; albeit led by Muslims; constitute and are supported by people of all religion and Muslims should refrain from shouting and chanting slogans like these to not give an edge to BJP and RSS&#x2019;s agendas. And instead of attacking <strong>Tharoor</strong> or <strong>Sadanand Dhume;</strong> Muslim liberals should instead take a lesson and keep the prayers at bay as <strong>Papri Banerjee</strong> brilliantly writes in her poem <strong><em>The Proper Secular Liberal</em></strong> &#x2013;</p><p>Muslims have been known to play the victim game whenever their identity is questioned or whenever they feel attacked for being a Muslim. And the same is happening in these protests around Jamia. They are using <em>Shahada</em> to claim that they help in keeping the spirits high of protesters but what they forget is that these slogans can be alienating towards other protesters who are not Muslim. These <em>Islamic fanatics</em> clearly have no clue that this is a fight for <strong>secularism</strong> and are pushing their own extremist agendas through these slogans in the protests.</p><p></p>, <strong>Yusuf Aziz<br>&#x2013; BA Hons.

Union Budget 2020: A Case of Three Themes, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/20200209_133523_0000.png?w=880&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>The longest Budget speech of Independent India brought triple themes for the Indian Economy. Although the budget &#x2018;seems&#x2019; pleasing for almost every sector; it could not substantiate the monotonous forgoing of the present economic crisis.</em></p><p>The Union Budget 2020 arrived with three themes i.e. Aspirational India; Economic Development; and Caring Society. Aspirational India includes Agriculture; Irrigation and Rural Development; Wellness; Water and Sanitation; and Education and Skills. Within the bracket of Economic Development comes Industry; Commerce and Investment; Infrastructure; and New Economy. Under Caring Society there are Women &amp; Child; Social Welfare; Culture and Tourism; and Environment and Climate Change.</p><p>Agriculture; Irrigation and Rural Development aims to achieve the goal of doubling farmers&#x2019; income by 2022. The Finance Minister; Nirmala Sitharaman introduces 16-point action plan in order to achieve this goal. The plan comes with<br>Implementation of model laws (issued by the Centre) undertaken by the respective States to be encouraged.<br>Comprehensive measures will be undertaken for 100 water stressed districts.<br>PM KUSUM expansion will provide 20 lakh farmers for standalone solar pumps and 15 lakh farmers for grid connected pumps.<br>Balanced use of all kinds of fertilizers.<br>Public Private Partnership mode adoption in order to set up efficient warehouses through Viability Gap Funding.<br>Village Storage Scheme to provide good holding capacity.<br>KISAN RAIL to build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables.<br>KRISHI UDAAN for both international and national routers.<br>&#x201C;One product one district&#x201D; in Horticulture Sector for better marketing and export.<br>Organic; natural and integrated farming measures.<br>Integration of e-NWR with e-NAM.<br>2020-21 target of Rs. 15 lakh crore set for agricultural credit.<br>Doubling of milk processing capacity by 2025.<br>Boosting of fisheries with Blue Economy.<br>Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana to mobilise SHGs for poverty alleviation.<br>An outlay of Rs. 2.83 lakh crore &#x2013; Rs. 1.6 lakh crore for agriculture and Rs. 1.23 lakh crore for rural development.<br>Under Wellness; Water and Sanitation; health sector has been allocated Rs. 69;000 crore inclusive of Rs. 6;400 crore of Prime Minister Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) while Rs. 12;300 crore has been given for Swachh Bharat Mission and Jal Jeevan Mission scheme Rs. 11;500 crore. The third item of Aspirational India; i.e.; Education and Skills; has been allocated with the amount of Rs. 99;300 crore for education sector and Rs. 3;000 crore for skill development. The new education policy is yet to be clarified by the government.<br>The Industry; Commerce and Investment of the theme &#x2018;Economic Development&#x2019; has been granted Rs. 27;300 crore for its development and promotion. The second item on the list of second theme is Infrastructure. One major port will be corporatized and will be listed under stock exchange. Allocation of Rs. 1.70 lakh crore has been done for transport infrastructure and Rs. 22;000 crore for power and renewable energy sector. Within the bracket of New Economy (third item); Bharatnet programme has been provided with Rs. 6;000 crore and an outlay of Rs. 8;000 crore over a period of five years for the National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications.</p><p>For Women &amp; Child; Social Welfare; the proposed budget for nutrition-related programmes has been allocated with Rs. 35;600 crore; Rs. 28;600 crore for programmes specific to women; Rs. 85;000 crore for SCs and OBCs; Rs. 53;700 for welfare of STs; and Rs. 9;500 crore for senior citizens and persons with disabilities. Under Culture and Tourism; tourism promotion and Ministry of Culture has received Rs. 2;500 crore and Rs. 3;150 crore respectively. Environment and Climate Change; i.e.; the last item of the last theme got the Ministry of Environment; Forest and Climate Change an allocation of Rs. 4;400 crore.</p><p>Apart from these allocations; a few things like certain imported military equipment; some India-made mobile components; Purified Terephthalic Acid; newsprint; sports goods; lightweight coated paper; and finger print reader have become cheaper whereas there is a huge list of items that turned costlier like skimmed milk; soya fibre; raw sugar; animal husbandry based products; imported items (including footwear; toys; mustard oil; ghee/butter/oil/cheese and many more); etc.</p><p>The Income Tax comes with two options provided one with four tax slabs (old) and the other with six tax slabs (new). The gaining point under tax &#x2013; Rs. 78;000 saved in taxes under the new tax system for individual earning Rs. 15 lakh according to the Finance Minister whereas the losing points &#x2013; Dividend Distribution Tax scrapped; but dividend gets taxed in your hands (those in 20% tax slab worse off); cess and surcharges stay the same; not providing any additional relief to tax payers; the effective tax rates are now ten due to slabs; surcharges; with the highest rate at 42.74%; and higher tax payers do not benefit; no real boost to money in hand even for those at lower levels.</p><p>LIC and IDBI disinvestment will bring transparency; depth to market which is good for stock investors. Although disinvestment will fix the fiscal deficit and deal with the economic crises in short run; surviving solely on it in long run won&#x2019;t. The rupee must come in through revenue more rather than capital in order to float the sinking ship. As the budget session went on; the corporate sector unexpectedly was not given due attention which resulted to Sensex showing the worst reactions to it heading to a crash. The implementation of the plan is what is being looked upon after the budget presentation.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credits: Deccan Herald</em></p>", <strong><em>Nabiha Fatima; B.Com.

Dr. Zakir Hussain Mausoleum and Museum; Jamia Nagar., https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/use-this-wp-template-2.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>Looking at the Mausoleum of Dr. Zakir Hussain in the middle of the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia; I couldn&#x2019;t help but think about how artificial the concept of time is and how the past and present; at some point of time; become merged into a sort of ubiquitous wetness that is time; where one cannot tell them apart.</em></p><p>Dr. Zakir Hussain Mausoleun and Museum; built by Habib Rahman and completed in 1971; stands as a beacon of rationality and modernism: perched atop a raised mound; it stands for the scientific ideal of a human being; a human being who is not bound by history but is standing outside of it; dictating his life according to his needs. Habib Rahman built three mausoleums in his lifetime: one for Maulana Abul Kalam Azad; which stands next to the Jama Masjid in Old Delhi; one for the former President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed; which is in Raisina; and the <em>mazaar</em> of Dr. Zakir Hussain; in the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia. These men; it can be argued; were the champions of his cause: they represented the conception of man that drove modernist architecture; learned; wise men who were not only aware of the history of this land and their communities; but wanted to move past them and add into this culture of scientific rationality that dominated the early years of Post-Independence India. And it is according to these basic scientific needs that this tomb was built: land; water; light. Its relation to history is only functional: it uses curving walls; inspired by some Tughlaq tombs built almost 700 years before it. The <em>mazaar</em>; with its curved walls with rough-cut marble surfaces; stands right next to the Jamia School campus; the first buildings to be erected here in the early 30s; which are more inspired by the buildings of Jacob Swinton; who believed in building according to how the ancestors of this land built &#x2014; something that is now called the Indo-Saracenic style. Behind the tomb is the Jamia Central Mosque; which represents some other architectural ideal for a religion; with its white minarets and huge domes.</p><p>The more I think about it; the more I believe that the past and present are two indistinguishable entities; existing not in a straight line; but side by side; telling us that we need to question what we perceive about time itself. &#xA0;Life; as most of us perceive it; is a constant process of unfolding; and there are certain things &#x2014; in this case; buildings &#x2014; that challenge this notion that we carry about life. The building will continue to stand there affirming the Heraclitan idea of time as a flowing river; unless we look at it as something that was built in the past and is just a passive reflection of the kind of thought that prevailed then; while we are comfortably grounded in the present; which remains a distinct entity from the past. But the building says something else. It was built according to the fundamental needs of humankind; needs that to some degree give a sense of order to our lives. The needs that Habib Rahman had in mind back are intrinsic to human nature: we have always needed to build according to land; water and light and these needs will remain at the core until our species inhabits this planet. The ideas of building here have been stripped to the bare minimum. Only the necessary is beautiful: the mausoleum and other modernist structures have been stripped of all their ornamentation &#x2014; which to Ruskin was the principal part of building &#x2014; and it is in this stripping of a building&#x2019;s very medium that our brain perceives the beauty of it. &#xA0;The mausoleum and the museum right next to it are a testimony to the culture of scientific rationality Nehru enthused into this nation; a vision of which Dr. Zakir Hussain was a huge part. He lies buried along with his wife under the fragile dome that is supported by the structure; for this was a fitting tribute to the life he lived.</p><p>Someone told me a story about how when Hakim Ajmal Khan was in Germany on his medical mission; he asked Dr. Hussain; if he took him to a barren piece of land in Delhi and tell him this was Jamia would he follow him; to which the answer was a simple yes. It was in 1926 that the latter came to Jamia Millia Islamia; when it was facing closure due to a paucity of funds; and remained its Vice-Chancellor until 1948; and left the University with a singular legacy: one of a relentlessly nationalist institution; dedicated to preserving its culture and educating its people in it; and as a singular voice against communalism; things that he took to personally. And maybe now; more than ever; his vision of what Jamia should be is coming to life. Jamia was instrumental in the efforts of the Indian state to safely rehabilitate refugees during the Partition: minibuses of students would go from the university to the refugee camp in Purana Qila with aid. He believed in Jamia as a carrier for a great spiritual renaissance; one that represented the awakening of India and her people into their own. Jamia was India&#x2019;s awkward foray into the truth of its own identity; of its own people. In 1948; he was appointed the Chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University; after which he went on to become the Governor of Bihar; and later; the third President of India and during his tenure he also acted as the Chancellor of the University. He had once written about how he would dedicate his life to Jamia; it was decided when he died that he would be buried in the University he built with his own hands. </p><p>I visited Dr. Zakir Hussain&#x2019;s mausoleum on a cloudy Tuesday afternoon. It stood there; with the kind of loneliness that a lot of modernist and brutalist buildings exhibit in solitude; with only a few people idling by at the museum nearby. Apart from a murder of crows; nobody really visits it. There is a certain beauty in the solitude of modernist buildings; for they often stand alone; like the ideas they once stood for. Jamia; and maybe even the country; are not what they were anymore. Maybe the temporal context in which the building stands has changed. Our needs are still the same; but we have created an illusion of reality for ourselves; a reality where we are more complex than our own inherent natures. Looking at this building made me look inward; onto my own needs and how there are certain things about our species that transcend all kinds of distinctions of the past and the present.</p>", <strong>Srajit M Kumar</strong><br>, Normal, 08/02/2020 
Recent Shooting Events in Delhi – A Report, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/use-this-wp-template.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1, <p></p><p>The previous week witnessed three incidents of firing amidst the anti-CAA protests in JMI and Shaheen Bagh. The first incidence took place on January 30; around 2 pm when a miscreant opened fire at people protesting near the JMI University; injuring a varsity student; Shadaab who was consequently rushed to AIIMS.</p><p>The witnesses claimed that the shooter screamed &#x201C;ye lo azaadi&#x201D; before firing and despite the area being surrounded by police; none intervened to disarm the attacker.</p><p>The Delhi Police arrested Gopal and has registered an attempt to murder charge against him.</p><p>On February 3; around 4:53 pm; another man fired two shots in the air at Shaheen Bagh near the anti-CAA protest site. While no protester was hurt; the witnesses recounted the attacker shouting &#x201C;Hindu Rashtra Zindabad&#x201D; before firing.</p><p>The shooter identified himself as Kapil Gujjar and denied being associated with any group. He could be heard saying &#x201C;jai Sri Ram&#x201D; and &#x201D; hamare desh me Kisi ki nahi chalegi sirf hinduo ki chalegi&#x201D; as the police proceeded to arrest him. On 2nd Feb; he was sent to police remand for two days by the court.</p><p>On February 2; around 11:30 pm; two unidentified men opened fire outside gate no.5 of JMI. No one was injured and as per the witnesses; one of the shooters was wearing a red jacket and was driving a red scooty having vehicle no. 1532 or 1534. Following the incidence; a large crowd gathered at gate no.7 late at night to join the on-going 24/7 protest and later proceeded to Shaheen Bagh.</p><p>&#xA0;The police said that they were verifying the accounts of witnesses. On that basis; an FIR had also been registered and a team would be sent to collect CCTV footage from Gate no. 5 and 7.</p>,<p><strong>Zainab Wahab</strong><br><strong>B.A. (Hons) English; Jamia Millia Islamia</strong></p>, Normal, 04/02/2020 
Pop the perpetual, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/use-this-wp-template-9.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1, <p>We all know that change is constant; we are constantly changing and so are the things around us. As we are reaching towards the end of a decade and beginning of a new one; we just wanted to acknowledge and list down all the changes we have been through in the last ten years. There are a lot of things that have evolved; from the fashion and beauty trends; to our preferences in entertainment; to our lifestyle and even our culture. We&#x2019;ll go over this in depth one by one; telling you what all new changes we have witnessed in the past decade.</p><p>If we are going to talk about any of the things mentioned above; the first thing that we need to talk about is the influence of social media and bloggers in our daily lives. There are so many social media platforms; started from Facebook and Twitter in the beginning of the decade and ending with Instagram; YouTube and Snapchat. There are so many bloggers out there who have made it their profession to influence people; in ways we never thought. From the fashion and beauty bloggers; to lifestyle and travel ones; we&#x2019;ve got all of them. Also; the involvement and interest of the Male gender into fashion and beauty has been tremendously increasing and we now even see some Male fashion bloggers as well; such as Abhinav Mathur; Jatinn Jay; etc.</p><p>Well apart from that; beginning from the fashion and beauty trends; we have seen changes all throughout; but the thing which was the highlight in the fashion industry was the transformation of the old-style clothing into a modern one. Bringing the trend of ghararas and shararas back into the society; and transforming them into clothes that can be worn on a daily basis has been an advancement. Also; the approach these days have been comfortable and casual over all. For the beauty thing; we have seen an incorporation of Korean skincare and American makeup into our daily routines. From the usage of sheet masks and serums; to that shiny highlighter; we&#x2019;ve seen it all in this decade.</p><p>Okay so now talking about the lifestyle; which has actually changed a lot; starting from the families: these days people prefer to live in a nuclear family rather than a joint one and also try to have a luxurious lifestyle. People have made up a mindset that having the most expensive phone; laptop; car; etc; is the status symbol for them in a society. And most of this and the expenditure of a family is because of the societal pressures to maintain their status. Mobile phones have become a large part of an individual&#x2019;s survival these days and has replaced the functions of an alarm clock; calendar; etc. &#xA0;Travelling has also become a huge trend; some people do it because they love to; but others just give in to the standards of living; and most of these standards are basically set by the influences of social media and bloggers.</p><p>The last thing that I want to mention is about our preferences in entertainment; that has been changing recently because of the availability of so much more than what we could just get. People; especially the youth have diverted from the typical Indian TV soaps to a variety of international ones like Elite (Spain); Ad&#x131;n&#x131; Feriha Koydum (Turkish); Zindagi Gulzar Hai and Humsafar (Pakistan); The Vampire Diaries and Pretty Little Liars (US); A Love So Beautiful (Chinese) and so on. We like them because of their unique and crisp storylines which end just in time. In addition to this; we would like to give a special mention to Netflix and Amazon Prime which has replaced the basic television in a household; and gives us large numbers of TV Shows and movies to watch. Also; if we are going to consider changes in the decade; how can we miss the music which started from One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer and is ending with the huge BTS popularity. We have seen K-pop and different regional music trending in the last 2-3 years; and making a name for themselves.</p><p>A lot of new trends have swayed away the old ones; but in a world where everything is constantly moving and evolving; there is nothing that stays forever; and we as people adapt to these changes pretty quickly as if we never noticed what around us has changed. So how many of these changes have you given in to?</p>, <strong>Shaireen Khan</strong><br><strong>B.A. (Hons) English; Jamia Millia Islamia</strong>, Normal, 03/02/2020 
Ghungroos that carry art: Tawaifs of India, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/use-this-wp-template-1.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>In the amnesic archives of history; you would come across the journey of these women who; now branded as mere prostitutes; were once the embodiment of refined culture and artistic talent.</em></p><p>The scarce delineation of female voices in the pages of history stands as a testimony of the marginalization of their contribution to the common struggles. And; within that paradigm; <em>tawaifs</em> or India&#x2019;s female entertainers were even more secluded.</p><p><em>Tawaifs</em>; the <strong>Awadhi</strong> term for highly skilled courtesans; rose to prominence between the 18th and 19th centuries in the royal courts of Awadh; part of present day Uttar Pradesh.<br>The benefaction of <em>tawaifs</em> to India&#x2019;s classical art was rescinded out of collective consciousness and their magnanimous stories found little mentions; even in the bottom lines of history after these professional singers and dancers were dubbed as prostitutes by the British; only to defame them.</p><p>Today; the word <em>tawaif</em> is more or less considered to be a profanity but it was not always the same; it was once considered to be a term of respect and not disdain. In their glory days; courtesans were known to be the repository of art and culture in India; skilled in both dance and music; they once represented the noon of Indian glamour and artistry. They also carried theatre and Urdu literary tradition; and went on to rule empires; lead armies and even worked as spies. They were rich; powerful and interestingly; &#x2018;independent&#x2019; women; considering the socio-political condition of that era. They employed male musicians; music and dance teachers; and even pimps who were employed by them to bring business. They broke several patriarchal boundaries. Men were dependent on them and it was not the other way round.</p><p>In erstwhile <strong>Lucknow</strong>; these &#x201C;dancing and singing girls&#x201D; were among the highest tax payers; when even the mention of women in tax records was a surprise enough. Also; they were making the largest individual incomes of any in the city. This does not end here; these women also owned manors; orchards; manufacturing and retail establishments of food and luxury items; which were also confiscated by British officials &#x2018;<strong>for their proven involvement in the siege of Lucknow and their participation in the first war of independence against British rule in 1857.</strong>&#x2019; In several other parts of the country; these women actively rebelled against the British Raj; and even supported the movement financially. As a result; not only their property was confiscated but the most attractive of <em>tawaifs</em> were sent to British garrisons to serve the troops there. Once the <em>tawaifs</em> who were considered to be the epitome of adab and an authority of etiquettes; the tawaifs who ardently contributed to classical music; dance and Urdu literature were now serving as common prostitutes.</p><p>These women are said to be the purveyors of varied art forms; they excelled in the performing arts such as <em>Kathak</em> and Hindustani classical music; as well as in literature like <em>ghazal</em> and <em>thumri</em>. They were considered to be the exponent of 64 kinds of art; and many of them were educated; their subjects being prose and poetry. Till the early 20th century; there are accounts of the most elite courtesans being invited to preside over discussions about literature because they were highly educated.</p><p>The first women of Hindi cinema were <em>tawaifs</em>. They went on to become successful writers; directors and producers. <strong>Jaddanbai</strong>; former <em>tawaif</em> and the mother of filmstar <strong>Nargis</strong> <strong>Dutt</strong>; was one of the first women to stir up the industry. When India entered the gramophone age; the first person to embrace the technology was <strong>Gauhar</strong> <strong>Jaan</strong>; a <em>tawaif</em>. There was a time; when being associated with a <em>tawaif</em> was considered to be a symbol of wealth; class; sophistication and culture. They were not synonymous to the women involved in flesh trade; and were neither pitied.</p><p>It is popularly believed that the sons from the noble families were sent to these <em>tawaifs</em> to learn <em>tehzeeb</em> and <em>tameez</em>; and the niceties of society; this also included the ability to differentiate good music and literature; and perhaps even practice it; especially the art of <em>ghazal</em> writing. By the closing of the 18th century; they had become the prime element of polite and refined culture in North India.</p><p>With the coming of colonialism; the presence of <em>tawaifs</em> started to be appalling as they did not adhere to the notions of Victorian morality and their shallow ideas of virtue. This brought a catastrophic end to this medieval institution of art and culture; and hence died; an era of poise; poetry; music and dance; an era of <em>arbab-e-</em><em>nishaat</em>.</p><p></p>", <strong>Nuzhat Khan</strong><br><strong>BA Hons English; Jamia Millia Islamia</strong>, Normal, 04/02/2020 
Space Combat in the 21st Century, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/use-this-wp-template-8.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>Do you remember the last time; when you gaze into the open sky; it is beautiful. Full of stars; dust and cosmic galaxy. We are in one corner of this vast universe.</em></p><p>When the cold war began; one thing that started with the weapons race was the space race. The humans in a way to outdo each other wanted to dominate the cosmic space. On October 4; 1957; the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik; the world&#x2019;s first man-made satellite; this small metal ball; smaller than 2 feet in diameter; launched an 18-year space race between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. Ironically U.S.S.R was not the first one rather was V2 rocket used by Germany in the last years of World War II in missile assaults on allied towns.</p><p>At the end of this entire space race; it was just a huge waste of moment that two main super-powers were attempting to outdo each other by creating symbolic initiatives that were both hazardous and costly; using funds that could have been better invested elsewhere; quite sure; but the greatest advantages of the space program had nothing to do with one nation defeating another in space.</p><p>The space; when accessible has opened a whole new domain of the warfare after the Space Race in the Cold War.</p><p>The Space Warfighting domain involves fighting that takes place in outer space; that is; outside the atmosphere. It therefore involves ground-to-space warfare; such as attacking satellites from Earth; and space-to-space warfare; such as satellites attacking satellites. In one view; it does not include the use of satellites for espionage; surveillance or military communications; although some writers prefer to include these military resources in the &#x201C;space&#x201D; aspect. Only a few occurrences of space warfare have happened in world history; and all of them have been coaching tasks; as compared to action against true opposing powers. In the mid-1980s; the P78-1; a communicating satellite in a 555 km orbit; was effectively shot down by anF-15 pilot. In 2007; China used a rocket scheme to kill one of its outdated satellites; and in 2008; its malfunctioning US-193 satellite likewise was destructed. To date; no human deaths have been recognized as a result of space war or a surface destination has been neutralized from the orbit. International space limits treaties or space disputes are regulated and arms; and particularly nuclear arms are limited to their assembly.</p><p>But for how long; we can control ourselves from not using the technologies that we possess?</p><p>A Project Excalibur; intended to detonate a nuclear weapon in Space; was developed in the 1970s by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Calibur. Lasers would then concentrate the ensuing x-rays on as many as 50 incoming rockets at a moment to ruin them as they did through space toward the US and its allies. However; the project crashed due to absence of advancement and financing. At present; the main use of lasers is to dazzle spy satellites and prevent them from collecting their data.</p><p>It is noted that China and Iran have accomplished so in exchange for US satellites and the West is probable to do so. This is likely to be the first strike in a space war. The satellites could also be the same. Hackers can even now work on inside spacecraft control structures artificially to position smart software routines.</p><p>This can be triggered by receiving a certain message or by fulfilling an onboard situation. The European Space Agency aims at protecting its satellites by creating quantum encoding methods for potential tasks. Consider this strategy as the brute force. This can also harm the attacker; so an advanced variant is a spaceship fitted with mechanical weapons; which grab the aim and remove solar panels or tools.</p><p>With all the developing technologies; it&#x2019;s not a hard fact that we might witness a full-scale space war. Joan Johnson-Freese; in his book; Space Warfare in the 21st Century: Arming the Heavens warns us; especially in the context of USA. Americans have spectacularly failed to hamper the spread of space technology and must therefore build a confident approach; primarily with China. It is excluded from civil and scientific mission collaboration; while the majority of other space-faring countries are involved. However; such a convincing strategy prescription is sheltered by a major problem reasoning that looks at spatial stabilization and safety isolated from Earth stabilization and safety. Deterrence is a fancy term; but we need a more decentered approach. Maybe; for now; the best is to protect yourself.</p>", <strong>Mantasha Sayed</strong><br><strong>B.A. (Hons) English; Jamia Millia Islamia</strong>, Normal, 02/02/2020 
An Authoritarian’s Old Tricks of Trade, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/use-this-wp-template-6.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>The makers of our constitution knew that in spite of the democratic structure democratic republics descend into oligarchy as demagogues install themselves as tyrants. They contemplated the history of other democracies and their own past and established a system of checks and balances. We may be tempted to think that the checks and balances provided in our Constitution would protect us from such threats. However; as history has shown rulers circumvent the law for their own benefit; or usurp power to establish tyranny. History does not just tell; it also instructs. Now may be a good time to learn from other people&#x2019;s mistakes.</em></p><p><strong>LANGUAGE AS A TOOL</strong></p><p>George Orwell in his essay Politics and the English language says; &#x201C;The half&#x2212;conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes&#x2026;if thought corrupts language; language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation; even among people who should and do know better.&#x201D; From Hitler to Britishers in India; language has been used as a tool to reject legitimate opposition. Today; in India; anyone who dares to say a word against the Modi government is immediately labelled an &#x2018;anti-national&#x2019;; while the word &#x2018;liberal&#x2019; is used as a cuss word. The people who make treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary to taint a dissident forget that the state and nation are two different entities.</p><p><strong>ERASURE OF PRIVACY</strong></p><p>Authoritarianism is not simply an all-power state. Authoritarians blur the lines between public and private space. Back in 2017; a nine-bench judge of the Supreme Court in a historic judgement ruled privacy a fundamental right following a decision over the contentious Aadhaar Card scheme. In 2019; again we debate the Personal Data Protection Bill and the draft Intermediary (amendment) Rules 2018; which give arbitrary power to the government over our data that is prone to misuse. Again; the attempt to pierce the privacy of individuals is not something new and as we lose our privacy; we become devoid of control over not just what we read but also how we act.</p><p><strong>ATTACK ON INSTITUTIONS</strong></p><p>The institutions-court; a law; the constitution; newspaper are there to protect us. The assumption that these institutions will protect themselves in the face of threats is misguided. These institutions enable rulers to come to power but the same rulers can destroy or alter the very same institutions. The ongoing youth-led; cross- section protests against the triumvirate CAA-NRC-NPR subvert the present government&#x2019;s idea of a homogenous society or a &#x2018;Hindu Rashtra&#x2019;.</p><p><strong>MYTH OVER FACTS</strong></p><p>Victor Klemperer observed that truth dies in four modes. First is the presentation of lies as if they were facts. The Prime Minister consistently resorts to lies and distorts history in his speeches; conveniently faltering dates; and sequences of events. The second mode is shamanistic incantation.&#xA0; The Modi-Shah duo have systematically used nicknames such as &#x2018;Tukde-Tukde Gang&#x2019; and even &#x2018;Chowkidaar&#x2019; to transform individuals into stereotypes. The third mode is use of</p><p>contradiction. The recent biggest contradiction has been Modi and Shah&#x2019;s statements on CAA-NRC. The final mode is people-worship or misplaced faith. This misplaced faith is on display when Venkaiah Naidu before taking the post of Vice-President said; &#x201C;Modi is God&#x2019;s gift to India&#x201D;. Or when a reporter asks; &#x201C;The GDP is falling. Do you still support BJP?&#x201D; and the Pavlovian response; stemming from a morass of indifference is; &#x201C;Modi humare bhagwaan hai&#x201D; (Modi is our God); no space is left for truth.</p><p><strong>SYMBOLS</strong></p><p>In 1993; when the Nazi Party came to power the Nazis organised a boycott of Jewish shops by marking one as &#x2018;Jewish&#x2019; the other as &#x2018;Aryan&#x2019;. The present government since it came to power sought out rewriting history by renaming streets; cities and other places. The Ministry of External Affairs; printed new passports with the lotus symbol on the pretext of enhanced security feature to identify fake passports. While; it is true that lotus is a national symbol; it cannot be forgotten that it is also the election symbol of Bhartiya Janata Party.</p><p>Authoritarians&#x2019; rejected reason in the face of myth; made self-deifying claims; propagated symbols of hate; attacked institutions; exploited free speech and the privacy of individuals to establish themselves as tyrants. The antidote was and is to establish a private life; believe in truth; remove the symbols of hate; protect the institutions that protect us; pay attention to the use of certain words and phrases.</p>", <strong>Maryam Ahmed</strong><br><strong>B.A. (Hons) English; Jamia Millia Islamia</strong>, Normal, 28/01/2020 
How politics assaults our psyche: In the light of the tussle between United States of America and Iran, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/use-this-wp-template-4.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>Anything can be politically manipulated if it is significant enough to be manipulated and this manipulation plays a major role in framing our day to day understanding of history; law; justice; power; mercy and humanity.</em></p><p>For those who believe that they are acting and making decisions out of their free will; their instincts are unaffected and they are at liberty to revamp it whenever they want to; the time has come to differentiate the world you&#x2019;re living in and the world you will never know; the time has come to awaken the dissenter in you who is audacious enough to assert that everything is manipulated; the opinions you have; the things you say; the rights you exercise; the society in which you live in and even the air you breathe. Since the time immemorial; you&#x2019;re being governed by the amateurs who neither have the right nor the virtue to govern you. Ironically; they are not the megalomaniac dictators but the democratically elected demagogues. Your democracies catalysed false consciousness which propitiously stimulated populism over rationalism and replaced reason with emotions and cheers; here you&#x2019;re living in technicolour post truth world!</p><p>To substantiate this; let&#x2019;s name the one who must be named over and over again; the Machiavelli of Indian politics &#x2018;Chanakya&#x2019;. As per his most celebrated work &#x2018;Arthashastra&#x2019;; a ruler need not to bring his promises to fruition and when subjects begin questioning things; a ruler is recommended to respond by attacking a neighbouring country and in the twinkling of an eye; everything will fall into line as it is an undeniable fact that petrifying one&#x2019;s own citizenry by synthetically created fear of foreign enemy is a tired old horse which the politicians have ridden to power for centuries.</p><p>Politicians of the largest democracies or may I say; kakistocracies have used this subterfuge time and again to deceive their own people and we being babe in the woods invariably welcome this manoeuvre with open arms which many a time; resulted in mass devastation of various countries; scores were killed; thousands were displaced and ultimately thrown a unipolar world at us with one dominant state asking other countries for veneration; not spiritual but material and I don&#x2019;t think that this state is need to be named. It&#x2019;s history of waging and sponsoring endless wars; vanishing civilizations; disfiguring thriving states and much loved wholesale murdering from Latin American countries to West Asian countries is internationally very well renowned.</p><p></p><p>The most recent of all is the assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani; second most powerful leader of Iran after religious leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Uncle Sam tried to legitimize this act of terror by fabricating various allegations against Soleimani; one of them being his involvement in various terrorist activities from London to New Delhi which is nothing more than an outright lie instead he was the major actor in terminating the Islamic State of Syria and Levant (ISIL). Most of us simply believe that Trump did so just to get away with Impeachment hearings just like all the other previous US presidents did for the fantasy lust for power. Not advocating for Iran but I would love to mention some facts here which can prove most of us right: United States first meddled in Iran&#x2019;s internal affairs when Iranian government nationalized it&#x2019;s oil as it was too much to bear for USA&#x2019;s economic interests in the region that it launched a coup d&#x2019;etat against democratically elected Mossadeq&#x2019;s socialist government in 1953 and replace it with the USA&#x2019;s loyalist Pahlavi dynasty. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi&#x2019;s rule in Iran was quite similar to that of Kemal Ataturk&#x2019;s in turkey. Although he was the stooge of USA; I admire him eminently for his persistent attempts to make Iran a modern secular state with &#x2018;White Revolution&#x2019; consisting various political; economic and social reforms. These reforms eventually redistributed land to some 2.5 million families; established literacy and health corps to benefit Iran&#x2019;s rural areas; furthered enfranchisement of women and ended the rule of Shariah. In subsequent decades; per capita income of Iranians skyrocketed and oil revenue fuelled an enormous increase in state funding for industrial development projects. Not rhapsodizing but being a law student; I cannot flunk the principle of &#x2018;audi alteram partem&#x2019; and demonize the Shah just because he was conditionally westernized and not a parochial neo traditionalist like the majority of Iran.</p><p><br>As I say; &#x2018;not only the religion but also the culture is opiate of masses&#x2019;. Imposition of western values led to the countrywide resentment as people saw Shah as a threat to their culture which in turn resulted in the Iranian revolution of 1979 where a Shia leader; Ruhollah Khomenei successfully mobilized people on religious lines and usurped the throne. This act of Khomenei can be considered as a classic example political manipulation of religion.<br>The key intent behind putting the example of US and Iran here is not only to explain the political manipulation by reshaping the hearts; minds; hopes and dreams of the citizenry but also to put that all of us are same be it Americans; Iranians or Indians etc irrespective of the sanctity of our borders. We all are designed to serve; inundated with the constant barrage of propaganda; our minds are moulded; our tastes are influenced; our words are exploited and our actions are coerced to accept the plattered lies; to be satisfied with the shows of flags and bucket full of nukes; to believe that war is peace; red is blue and girls are boys and slavery is freedom.</p><p><br>By reversing the case here; it can be avowed that the assassination of Soleimani worked in Iran&#x2019;s favour. Coincidentally; at the time of Soleimani&#x2019;s assassination; people in Iran were protesting against the corrupt government; unemployment; human rights abuses; hike in fuel prices and demanding the overthrow of the religious leader; Khamenei but in the fraction of second; everything has changed. Now; people are not protesting against Khamenei but rallying to show their love for Soleimani; right hand of Khamenei which ultimately suppressed the popular dissent against the government. Now; you all are free to use your minds cum catacombs and relate this post truth idea with all the communal riots happened in India just before the elections.</p><p><br>Anyway; this uncontrollable phenomenon of psychological manipulation for political gains is inevitable and will stop only by overcoming the shortage of outlaws in your society; by outgrowing the knee-jerk reflection of what people wants you to think and most importantly; by decontrolling your own selves.</p>", <strong>Sadaf Parvez<br>B.A. LLB; Jamia Millia Islamia</strong>, Normal, 26/01/2020

Currently; the whole of India is witnessing massive public agitations and protests against the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAA); NRC and NPR. It would not be wrong to say; that Jamia Millia Islamia has turned to be the &#x2018;epicentre&#x2019; of this leaderless national movement against CAA-NRC-NPR. But this is not the first time that Jamia Millia has played a major role in a national movement. It had played a significant role during the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Indian Freedom Struggle for Independence.</em></p><p>Jamia Millia Islamia emerged as the first educational institution which came into existence as a result of the nationwide call to boycott all the educational institutions run by the British Empire. This nationwide call was a part of the Non-Cooperation Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi; after the massacre of Jallianwala Bagh and the imposition of the Rowlatt Act in 1919. Gandhi acted as a catalyst between the Congress and the Khilafat leaders; and not only called for the boycott of British supported institutions; but also the titles and the foreign goods. They appealed for a non-violent struggle against the British Empire keeping in mind the importance of Hindu-Muslim unity.</p><p><strong>History of Foundation</strong></p><p>Renowned historian; S.N Sen wrote in his book &#x2018;History of the Freedom Movement in India&#x2019; (1857-1947); that the British made the Muhammadin Anglo-Oriental College of Aligarh into a university and thus Aligarh Muslim University came into existence in September 1920. This resulted in quitting off the university by many students and professors; as part of the Non-Cooperation Movement. Maulana Mehmud Hasan; Maulana Mohamed Ali Jauhar; Hakim Ajmal Khan; Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari; and Abdul Majid Khwaja were the professors who disassociated themselves from AMU and are considered as the Founding Fathers of Jamia Millia Islamia.</p><p>A group of 18 intellectuals was formed (known as Founding Committee); which set up a new institution in temporary camps in the same city; Aligarh. They named it &#x2018;Jamia Millia Islamia&#x2019; making it the first national institution as an alternative to the British supported institutions. Physician and poet; Hakim Ajmal Khan was made its first chancellor; and Mohammad Ali Jauhar first vice-chancellor. Mohammad Ali Jauhar was also the founder of the Khilafat Movement in India and his name still remains a legacy for the students of Jamia Millia.&#xA0; He once said; &#x2018;We must have in us the will to die; for the birth of India as a free and united nation.&#x2019;&#xA0; Jamia started off well and was able to enrol a large number of students coming from Muslim and other marginalized families.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>A Journey of Ups and Downs!</strong></p><p>It was during 1922-1924 when both; the Non-Cooperation and the Khilafat Movement were called off. This led to a huge financial crunch for Jamia Millia; and it led the institution into a major financial crises.&#xA0; The only funds it received were in the form of donations from its founders and from a few anti-British intellectuals. Dr. M.A Ansari and others including Gandhi travelled to various parts of India in order to mobilise funds for running Jamia Millia Islamia smoothly. Infact; Gandhi was a lifelong friend of Jamia Millia Islamia. Gandhi had not only played a major role in its establishment; but also had contributed a lot in its development over the years.</p><p>Journalist and an alumnus of Jamia; &#x2018;Afroz Alam Sahil&#x2019; in his book &#x2018;Jamia Aur Gandhi&#x2019; writes; &#x201C;Gandhi contributed a lot to Jamia and he also received a lot from the institute. It wouldn&#x2019;t be an exaggeration to say that Gandhi had a special affection towards Jamia. As much as Gandhi understood Jamia; the institute also gave an equal amount of love and respect to him.&#x201D;</p><p>When in 1925; Jamia was still not able to recover from the financial crises and the founders were considering closing it down; it was Gandhi who insisted that Jamia should not be closed down. He said; &#x201C;Aapko rupya ki diqqat hai to mein bheekh maang lunga (&#x2018;if you&#x2019;re facing a financial crunch; then I am ready to beg&#x2019;). He had lots of hope from Jamia Millia that it would set up an example of Hindu-Muslim unity in the country.</p><p>&#xA0; Steadily; the financial conditions improved and the campus was shifted from the temporary camps in Aligarh to Karol Bagh in Delhi; somewhere in 1925. Later in 1935; the campus was again shifted to its current location; in Jamia Nagar; Okhla.</p><p><strong>Participation in the Freedom Struggle</strong></p><p>Right from its inception during the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movement in the 1920s; till the time we achieved Independence in 1947; Jamia Millia Islamia has been an active participant in the freedom struggle. Freedom fighter and India&#x2019;s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru commented that; Jamia is a &#x201C;lusty child of the non-cooperation days.&#x201D; When in 1928 Bardoli Satyagraha was being carried out under the leadership of Vallabhai Patel; Jamia Millia actively participated throughout. Students and teachers of Jamia travelled across the country as volunteers; to educate; motivate and organise people to fight for the freedom of India.</p><p>Popular Indian writer Munshi Premchand; had written a report about the role of Jamia and its leaders in 1932 during Colonial India and pointed out that &#x201C;their role in the anti-colonial struggle could not be questioned and hence; their nationalist and patriotic credentials are deeply connected to the Indian nation and beyond doubt.&#x201D;</p><p>Even in 1946; when Jamia Millia was celebrating its Silver Jubilee the then Vice Chancellor; Dr. Zakir Hussain (later the President of India); appealed from the podium to strive for peace and harmony; and maintain Hindu-Muslim unity. Leaders from both; the Congress and the Muslim League were present in these gatherings. The students and teachers of Jamia Millia tried to convince the Muslims to choose an inclusive India; and reject Jinnah&#x2019;s two nation theory. But despite of all the efforts by secular and peace loving leaders; India was divided into India and Pakistan; on 15<sup>th</sup> August 1947.&#xA0;</p><p>Soon after the partition; Delhi&#x2019;s atmosphere was filled with communal sentiments; and it resulted in bloodshed in many parts of the country.</p><p>To conclude I&#x2019;ll just say that; it is the duty of every Jamian to live up to the dreams of our Founding Fathers. It is not only our duty; but our responsibility to make India a more secular; tolerant and a democratic country.</p>", <strong>Sahil Kazmi</strong><br><strong>BBA; Jamia Millia Islamia</strong>, Normal, 26/01/2020 
Rohith Vemula: The Fatal Accident that took India by the Storm, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/use-this-wp-template-8.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>On the 17th of January 2016; the walls of the confinement of Uma Anna witnessed something that would ring in the miseries of the administration. The body of Rohith Vemula hung from the ceiling fan; lifeless and torpid. This tragedy sparked up a series of protests throughout the country; only to find itself in the pit of an unresolved matter.</em></p><p>Rohith Chakravarti Vemula was a PhD scholar in the University of Hyderabad. Apart from being a student; he was also an avid member of the Ambedkar Students&#x2019; Association (ASA). Initially he was a part of the Students Federation of India but gradually he realized that the association was a Hub of of classism and casteism. Being from a socially backward sect; he was often criticized and doubted on his authenticity of admission to the university. Undergoing adversities of caste discrimination in the campus; Rohith Vemula and his friends eventually started raising agitation under the banner of ASA. In the wake of this agitation they were falsely accused for assaulting an ABVP member. On the 5th of August; the University set up a panel to investigate into the matter and on the urge of a BJP MP and the Union Minister; Rohith along with four of his friends were suspended from the University in September. Their suspension did not deter their spirits and they set up tents in the campus itself and began a relay hunger strike.</p><p>Rohith Vemula was from a family which earned barely enough to make their ends meet. The stipend which he received from the University was the sole source of income for his family; which was curbed a long time back in 2015. Being vocal and opined about the prevailing discriminations and having a dream of living in an atmosphere of equality lead to his expulsion from the University. One event leading to another became a source of pessimism for him. He gradually lost hope from the administration and his life. This led him to take his life on the 17th of January 2016. Rohith was often described by his friends as a person with a vision and a leader with integrity and positivity. He was always the one who never had futile discussions with people. He always talked about ways of protests and amendments that could take them closer in their venture. He was an admirer of science and nature and a fanatic of stars. He was an avaricious reader and a cynosure of knowledge.</p><p>His demise took the country by storm and was a surge of disappointment for his family and friends. It led to a series of countrywide protests and student agitation. Sadly; the matter that was investigated after his death was not the accountability of the administration but the caste to which Rohith Vemula actually belonged. Indeed; a very diminutive issue to debate upon; but an important matter for the politicians.</p><p>His letter which he had written before he committed suicide left an impression that is difficult to heal from. An excerpt from his letter that could devour anyone&#x2019;s soul. &#x201C;I always wanted to be a writer. A writer of science; like Carl Sagan. I loved Science; Stars; Nature; but then I loved people without knowing that people have long since divorced from nature. Our feelings are second handed. Our love is constructed. Our beliefs colored. Our originality valid through artificial art. It has become truly difficult to love without getting hurt.The value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a vote. To a number. To a thing. Never was a man treated as a mind. As a glorious thing made up of star dust. In every field; in studies; in streets; in politics; and in dying and living. I am writing this kind of letter for the first time. My first time of a final letter. Forgive me if I fail to make sense. My birth is my fatal accident. I can never recover from my childhood loneliness.

A Distant Echo in a Juggernaut: Lost Voices of Tripura in CAA, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/use-this-wp-template-2.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1," <p><em>While Assam and Delhi became epicenters of CAA resistance; the resolute voices of Tripuri people got trampled on in the cacophony of mixed stands of protests. What went wrong? The ignorance of national media; dried hopes of the indigenous tribes or sick politics at play-it&#x2019;s more than a matter of existence for indigenous Tripuris!</em></p><p>The whole of Northeast India burned in peril in turn of the events that shaped the momentum of CAA. Many might snicker at the thought; but the truth speaks for itself-the Northeast has always been sidelined in the Indian state. And now out of nowhere the so called &#x2018;torch bearers&#x2019; -the igniters of our economy want to dump a whole set of outsiders population in the already populated 7 sisters! The people of Northeast have always struggled with their existence with such a diverse ethnic population of 10-20 indigenous communities residing in each of the states. We have always a remained a harmonious region but silence does not mean we will take the toll of immigrants barging in our homes and snatching our lands; our rights; our jobs.</p><p>Assam and Tripura which borders Bangladesh on two sides went into a state of frenzy over this sudden bomb. While violent turns of protests and agitations took momentum in Assam; Tripura failed to garner the limelight. The Act sparked both outrage and celebration in the tiny frontier state of Tripura. While firecrackers went off in the Bengali dominated Agartala; the capital city; the tribal dominated hill districts erupted in protests and mayhem. Tripura; which came to be known as a Bengali dominated state; has 19 ethnic communities- the Reangs; Brus; Kokis etc. The atrocious Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA) reignited old hostilities and animosity between Bengalis and Tripuri tribal communities; releasing another fresh surge of violence in the state- an internal battle resurfacing again.</p><p>On one hand; Tripuris were resolutely protesting in the streets against CAA in the face of an incumbent BJP government; on the other hand their numbers were dwindling by the stroke of midnight as indigenous Tripuris were being picked up from homes; assaulted on the streets; slaughtered and slandered in broad daylight- a part of the package that national media fails to cover. Tripura has been infiltrated by Bangladeshis since partition in 1947 and 1971. The local population of the combined 19 communities has come down to 39% while that of Bengalis shot up to 62% in the last decade and most of the locals are settled in the hills; unable to use their own resources. Their lands have been scorched upon; most of the government jobs are in the hands of refugees or Bengalis; they have to walk miles to access whatever form of education they can get; their markets vandalized either by Bangladeshi refugees or state dominating Bengalis- in short Tripuris cant have a peaceful breath in their own motherland- there&#x2019;s a constant fear surging inside.</p><p><em>&#x201C;<strong>Homeless in Homeland. Home is where we love-home that out feet may leave but not our hearts and one day I will bring back the light in my homeland; my home.&#x201D;</strong></em><strong> </strong><br>&#x2013;<em> A displaced Tripuri</em></p><p class=""has-text-align-center"">A <em>Reang student of Jadavpur University recalls his nightmare when he witnessed his uncle slaughtered in the middle of the street and nearby houses torched.</em></p><p>The dust have barely settled in Kanchapur subdivision after two weeks when violent clashes broke between Brus and Hindu Bengalis. &#x201C;<em>We don&#x2019;t despise the Bengalis; we are against the influx of Bangladeshi Bengalis. Sometimes I feel like a stranger in my own town-there&#x2019;s no Reang; Kuki; Oraon; Uchai or any similar face in the streets&#x201D;; an accused said. </em>Tripuris have faced years of indignation; discrimination in their own homeland and like many other issues of <strong>Incredible India;</strong> it has gone unrecognized by benches of cabinets now and before and the Indian media seems to be tantalizing in its own world of power demographics. Some of the communities are on the brink of extinction; many are leaving their homes and meagre lands for safer routes; they are downgraded to the level of mendicants in the land they were born and raised! They couldn&#x2019;t tell Indian Bengalis from the Bangladeshi Bengalis-they spoke the same tongue after all. They have no means to retaliate; only passing the days to get out of this rat hole or living this ghastly nightmare every day to the very end with no hopes of a reconciliation. They somewhat resemble the Kashmiri Pandits; only their stories never seem to see the light and maybe would go unsung; untold even years from now.</p><p>Voices of dissent did grow in Tripura against CAA; no one would stay silent if your identity is at stake ;but they died down as fast as a bolt of lightning; how could anyone see their family getting killed in front of them and have no one to go to but that&#x2019;s how their lives are-after all they have gone unknown for decades now. They know their truth; the Northeast know their truth; but will the rest of the world ever get to know it or will they just end up as an extinct population enriching our folklores- the question looms bigger than ever!</p>", <strong>Syeda Peenaz Seerat</strong><br><strong>B.A. (Hons) English; Jamia Millia Islamia</strong><br>, Normal, 23/01/2020 
Experience normalcy; visit Kashmir, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/experience-normalcy-visit-kashmir.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>It has been more than five months of lockdown in Kashmir; these days you see the showcasing of less and less protests; stone-pelting; militancy and civil disobedience in media. So; has Kashmir finally achieved a state of normalcy?</em></p><p>What&#x2019;s normal is for the most part debated all over in regards to the state of Kashmir; what&#x2019;s normal is what&#x2019;s usual; expected and ordinary; it also is in part; a sum of history. What&#x2019;s normal for the Scandinavian Army is different from the normal of US Army. What&#x2019;s normal for the people of Delhi is different from the people of Kashmir &#x2013; obvious. Although; one generally perceives the &#x201C;normal&#x201D; of all others to be in accordance with one&#x2019;s own normal state. Thinking of Kashmir as &#x201C;normal&#x201D; would require the assessment of history and the contemporary.</p><p>One of the most prevalent fossils of Kashmir; that apparently show what Kashmir was before the abrogation of 370; includes it being bigoted; misogynistic; casteist; homophobic and xenophobic etcetera. A Kashmir that burns schools; attends the funeral of &#x201C;terrorists&#x201D;; that ethnically cleansed the Pandits; waves Pakistani flags and the list goes on. All of this is based on the idea that the &#x201C;special status&#x201D; (Article 370 &amp; 35a) were the catalysts in the concoction-witch-pot. Media can&#x2019;t get enough of the &#x201C;developments&#x201D; that are going to happen in J&amp;K now and the introduction of IPC and reservations. This idea is dangerous; when people start to think that their idea of the world is the one supreme; is how dictators come into power; how Holocausts and Gulags are inspired. The dictions mentioned do exist in J&amp;K; although it&#x2019;s just the surface of the ocean. The &#x201C;terrorists&#x201D; are seen as martyrs in Kashmir; so in that sense they are nationalists in their own confined way; this is in no way justification of either but the reasoning that is always looked over. For example; if Kashmir is homophobic and isn&#x2019;t now after the abrogation; then so was rest of India till September 2018 and then magically now isn&#x2019;t; which we know is absurd. Even if it was about changing law for the favoring of such sects of the society; those laws very well could&#x2019;ve been incorporated into the constitution of Kashmir; as was done before. Still; laws don&#x2019;t change minds; they restrict; for good or bad; changing laws is for sure an opening but not the entire road.</p><p>The normal of Kashmir was &#x201C;martyrs&#x201D;; &#x201C;oppression&#x201D;; &#x201C;human right violations&#x201D;; &#x201C;shutdown of internet&#x201D;; &#x201C;PSA&#x201D; and all which still remain; and the expectation of change in correlation of time is a utopian diction; there is change without procedure and the Government has always used terms like &#x201C;security review&#x201D;; &#x201C;appropriate measures&#x201D; to cover the answers with diversion; and anything; almost anything &#x201C;they&#x201D; think is viable can be done under this blanket. Hitler once &#x201C;assured&#x201D; the Jews that the Nuremberg Law won&#x2019;t affect them. How twisted the play of words with legalities can become was made clear by Martin Luther King when he said; &#x201C;We should never forget that everything Hitler did was &#x2018;legal&#x2019; and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did was &#x2018;illegal&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Normalcy&#x201D; is all what the law is made to mould a condition to; in Kashmir some say was all what is aforementioned and now the normal has changed or will change and for some after five months of shutdown the UT is now normal. People have to live their lives; they obviously can&#x2019;t shut their shops forever; they can&#x2019;t not go to schools forever; they can&#x2019;t not abide by the laws used to control them forever (because then facilities are shutdown) and the Government knows this. So; if normal is what can be changed as one pleases it to be; the question becomes not if everything is under &#x201C;normalcy&#x201D; in Kashmir but if there&#x2019;s anything at all against it.</p>", <strong>Raafat Gilani</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) English; Jamia Millia Islamia </strong>, Normal, 21/01/2020 
Exodus 1990: An Unsung Story of Kashmiri Pandits, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/20200118_221216_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>30 years of a dreadful event that still frightens the sufferers and the ensuing tales are substantial to press the redemption of dues. 19th January of 1990 is a horror for thousands of Kashmiri Pandits; who await rightful affirmation.</em> </p><p>There has been a long history of atrocities faced by the Kashmiri Hindus even before the day of the exodus. The genocide took place after a Srinagar based newspaper Aftab published a message asking all the Hindus in the valley to leave immediately. Masked goons with armed weapons used to force the locals to reset their time to Pakistan Standard Time. On the night of 18 January; a blackout took place in the Kashmir Valley to instil fear inside Hindus who lived there; asking for their purge.</p><p>We all have a different kind of emotional attachment to our homeland; places from where we belong. Something nobody can take away from us; somewhere we are always welcomed. But what do you do when one day; everything is taken away from you? We&#x2019;re all privileged in one way or another; there are always going to be people who have it worse than you; which is the ultimate argument people bring every time we face hardships; but when it comes to the horrors these righteous people went through; they have the utmost right to call other people privileged and claim that they did have it worst. So many of these people had to leave their women behind. When does it ever happen that you stop feeling safe in your own home? The pain of leaving everything behind is enough; but the pressure and fear of starting over? Enough of overlooking their sufferings. When your fight for a cause is restricted to support one particular community; then your fight is meaningless and futile.</p><p>30 years later; some would say that it has been long enough and these people are well settled but that&#x2019;s just the proportion of them that have made themselves able to share their stories. Many of them didn&#x2019;t even survive the exodus. And it was never about being settled with your new life; it was and always will be about their inability to go back to their homes; or rather houses that turned into ash.</p><p>Many Kashmiri pandits who were born after their families had fled Kashmir; feel a strong affinity for Kashmiri culture. Just like Punjab; Kerala; Rajasthan and many other Indian states; Kashmir also has a separate culture. Kashmiris have their own prominent dishes cooked at different Kashmiri festivals and their very own music. We surely do remember studying about dance; food; language; and clothes of different states but why did our textbooks lack this evidence about Kashmir? Where did the Kashmiri culture go?<br>Kashmir has its very own language known as Koshur which isn&#x2019;t spoken a lot; as; over these years the circumstances have snatched Kashmiris of their mother tongue; making them distant from their own culture.</p><p>Aayush Raina a Kashmiri Hindu student said &#x201C;I never got to live in Kashmir. I was born post exodus and my parents never talked about it; at least in front of me. I used to ask them why we don&#x2019;t live in Kashmir if we&#x2019;re Kashmiri; they would say that we migrated out of Kashmir and digress from the subject. Little did I know the things they had to face. We&#x2019;ve lived in exile for 30 years now; refugees in our own country. My people were forced to leave their homes overnight due to the outbreak of militancy in Kashmir. The place they were fleeing for their lives was once their home and the people standing against them were once their own. The people you see on the streets these days opposing a mere shut down of internet; yeah; they weren&#x2019;t there at that time. Our elders protested as much as they could but they were less in number. Their voices went unheard. For years; life moved on and the pain was suppressed with responsibilities to give their families a better life but the wounds are still open. They seek justice. They seek their homeland. Our genocide is finally getting acknowledged. But there are many who disregard this brutal ethnocide with false narratives. This disheartens me. They ask us to forget it because we&#x2019;ve lived privileged lives. Well; I can&#x2019;t! I&#x2019;m not privileged enough to forget the brutalities my people faced. The men killed; women and children abducted; raped and slaughtered. I&#x2019;m not privileged enough to forget that while most of us; including my parents; were able to build a life out of the ashes; many weren&#x2019;t; they&#x2019;re still living in refugee camps.I&#x2019;m not privileged enough to forget the pain.&#x201D;</p><p>Our Kashmiri brothers have demanded justice at every step but they were always denied the same. People even failed to acknowledge their history. Indians who flee Pakistan prior the partition were given all kinds of aid from the government; they were provided with land to start a new life when they came prepared with resources; but what did the Government do for Kashmir Pandits when all they could bring with them was themselves alive? Kashmiri Pandits are the most suffered yet neglected group of people. The Government completely ignored their existence and saw them as nothing but vote-banks.</p><p>After decades of struggle and striving for recognition; finally when the history of Kashmiri Pandits came to the knowledge of the common man; a lot of people very easily overlooked it that it happened long ago; or see it as an act of publicity or gaining sympathy. A fraction of India still looks at them as the problematic committee. A trailer for a movie called Shikara which is based on the real life events that took place due to the exodus and highlights the story of the 30 years of exile; recently came up on the Internet and within 10 days of its launch; the trailer had 26;000 dislikes; even after 30 years. That speaks volumes.</p><p>We as a nation have failed them multiple times. They deserve nothing but our utmost support and respect always. We will never forget the horrors they faced and shall hope one day; they return to their homes that await them.</p>, <strong><em>Avni Dhawan; University of Delhi</em></strong>, Normal, 18/01/2020 
CAA 2019: Beyond the Horizon, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/use-this-wp-template.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1, <p>The Divider in Chief&#x2019;s team with its unabated endeavor to transform secular India into a Hindu Rashtra (read &#x2018;Aryavarta&#x2019;) has been given a brand new momentum with the enactment of Citizenship (Amendment) Act;2019 which discriminates against illegal Muslim immigrants over their rights to citizenship; while favoring the people of other religious communities namely Hindus ;Jains. Buddhists; Sikhs; Parsis and Christians. This highly shismatic Act (coupled with the proposed pan India NRC) is creating vexation into Indian muslims about their fate is the material manifestation of the long lasting ideological goals of the ruling dispensation which seeks to reduce them to the status of second class citizens. This Act comes after the despotic action taken in August in Muslim dominated Indian administered Kashmir where abrogation of the special status provided under article 370 of Indian constitution was accompanied by a massive communication blackout that is still mostly operative and Indian apex court has failed in its duty to enforce fundamental rights by giving a reprehensible judgement on internet blackout imposed in the state of Kashmir after stripping it of its special status wherein it merely gave a lip service to the fundamental rights without providing any immediate relief to the people living in predicament there. It also follows another hindu nationalist &#x201C;judicial&#x2019; triumph when the Supreme Court in November rewarded the &#x201C;egregious violation of the rule of law; and paved the way for the construction of a grand Ram Mandir on a 16th century mosque which was demolished by the right wing hindu nationalists at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh in 1992. These recent political developments in India are exposing the tyrannical and abominable side of India; which is certainly losing its image globally as a secular and all welcoming society. Now this Act will herald a dark dawn of oppression to its most marginalized religious minority.</p><p><strong>What this act is all about</strong>:</p><p>The statement of object and reasons of this act stipulates that it will grant amnesty to the afformentioned persecuted minorities by providing them fast track citizenship but this term &#x201C;persecuted minorities&#x2019; finds no mention in the act itself. The question arises whether this impugned act (which has been challenged in the apex court through numerous writ petitions) will sustain the test of constitutionality. The authors here are trying to explain all the legal nuances of this impugned act and its betrayal to the Northeastern States.</p><p><strong><u>Determining the constitutionality of this Act</u></strong></p><p>Citizenship Amendment Act is a sheer violation of article 14 which provides equality before law and equal protection of law. This article contemplates two tests: An act that is enacted by the parliament should be based on an intelligible diiferentia. This term has been explained by the apex court in Anwar Ali Sarkar case in which the court said that there should be a yardstick to classify people and such classification should be intelligible. There must be a yardstick to differentiate between those which have been included in and those who have been excluded from. Justice Indu Malhotra further glossed the explanation of this term in Navtej Singh Johar case wherein she infused the grounds of article 15(Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion ; race; caste; sex or place of birth) into article 14 and opined that no doubt there should be an intelligible differentia while classifying the people for providing them benefit but such classification must be a reasonable one. She further expounded that this classification should not be based on an intrinsic and core traits of an individual. If any law differentiates on the basis of these core traits then such law would not be able to pass the test of constitutional principles; and accordingly it would be declared unconstitutional. Religion is one of the basic traits of an individual which is a personal choice of an individual therefore no law can accord citizenship on the basis of an individual&#x2019;s religion. Therefore; contrary to Article 15; the test for Article 14 violation is based on impermissible classification. Impermissible classification means that a particular principle cannot be used to classify because it is constitutionally irrelevant. Religion is a facet of personal autonomy; and a classification based on it is an impermissible classification.</p><p><strong>Not based on any determining principle</strong></p><p>Nariman J in Shayara Bano case has noted; &#x201C;manifest arbitrariness; is something done by the legislature capriciously; irrationally and/or without adequate determining principle. Also; when something is done which is excessive and disproportionate; such legislation would be manifestly arbitrary.&#x201D; There is no watertight separation between all fundamental rights as propounded by J. Fazl Ali in AK Gopalan v. State of Madras case which was further bolstered by the Supreme Court in Bank Nationalisation case by opining that all fundamental rights have to be read together while testing the constitutionality of a law enacted by the parliament thereby overruled the silos theory of AK Gopalan case. No doubt parliament has unfettered power of enacting a law related to citizenship by virtue of article 11 of Indian constitution but it has been inhibited from enacting a law (like this impugned act) which discriminates on the ground of religion by excluding a particular section of the society.</p><p><em>The second thing where this bill fails to pass the test of article 14 is that its main objective is to protect the religious persecuted minorities but here they have assumed that only these people are being persecuted in these countries without recognizing the ordeal of those who are being bludgeoned within a religion on sectarian ground. Therefore; it contradicts itself in two ways: firstly; it wants to protect all those who are living in quandary and being forced to flee from their countries by providing them citizenship on humanitarian ground but on the other side it fails to recognize the persecution of other people within a particular religion. It is quite apparent that other people within a religion like Ahmadiyas; Shias and Hazaras are often being forced to live in predicament and without accepting this fact; this classification based on the majority and minority will have no nexus with the object of protecting religious persecuted minorities and is bound be struck down by the Court on ground of violating article 14.</em></p><p>This act unnecessarily encompasses the name of those communities of which it is going to protect from religious persecution which they have been endured to face in their own country of origin. However; if intention was to salvage the persecuted people then why have other people; who are also being humiliated and demeaned in the same manner; been excluded from getting the benefit of this act. This makes this Act manifestly arbitrary and seems to have been made with the intention of providing benefit to the certain sections of the society because it creates differences among equally footing people who have been forced to flee from their countries. If you see the Ahmediyas who are not considered as the muslims and have been ostracized from practicing and professing Islam overtly. Why these people have not been included in the bill is devoid of any logic which renders this impugned act again something that is fraught with prejudices and proclivities that again points towards vindicating the point of manifest arbitrariness which is an anathema to article 14.</p><p><strong>Country-based Classification</strong></p><p>The country-based classification is manifestly arbitrary also and violative of Article 14; it is not based on a plausible determining principle because three countries have been identified to provide citizenship to the resident of these countries who are being persecuted in these countries. If the classification is based on the assumption that they were the part of undivided India then such classification is destined to fail because Afghanistan was not the part of undivided India. If the classification is premised on this ground that these countries which have been selected have a state religion i.e. Islam but Srilanka and Bhutan have not been incorporated that have a state religion too that is Buddhism wherein the Tamil and the Christian are persecuted too respectively. Even Christians in Bhutan are not allowed to pray in church therefore they have to make prayer in their own houses or sometimes they cross over the border of their own country for getting shelter in India so that they could perform their prayer without any apprehension of being harrased. If the classification is based on the ground that these communities that have been enlisted into this Act are facing persecution because they belong to a particular religion but again this is idiocy to say that Rohingyas are not being persecuted because of their religion but they have not been incorporated into this act. Therefore; it is evident that the exclusion of the other neighboring countries where people face religious persecution is not justified; because the inclusion of these three countries is not based on any determining principle be it Indian origin; state religion; or of persecuted minorities. Thus; the country based classification is violative of Article 14 as it suffers from the vice of manifest arbitrariness. </p><p><strong><u>Direct and inevitable consequence of a statute</u></strong></p><p>It is now a well settled law that the violation of fundamental rights are considered on the basis of inevitable and and direct consequence of an act. The apex Court in Bacchan Singh case held &#x201C;that in order to locate the fundamental right violated by a statute; the court must consider what is the direct and inevitable consequence of the statute. The impugned statute may in its direct and inevitable effect invade more than one fundamental right and merely because it satisfies the requirement of one fundamental right; it is not freed from the obligation to meet the challenge of another applicable fundamental right.&#x201D; That; the direct and inevitable consequence of promulgating the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 would be that the Hindu migrants excluded from the final list of NRC for the residents in Assam published on 31.08.2019; would be entitled to get benefit of naturalization under Section 6B of Citizenship Act. However; the Muslim migrants who stand in equal footing with the Hindu migrants; are nevertheless denied the same legal protection. Therefore; the Citizenship Amendment Act; 2019 ensures that the proceedings before the Foreigner Tribunal and detention would be directly targeted against the Muslims alone. As the Home Minister has announced in the parliament that they will be implementing pan India NRC (National Register of Indian Citizens) in upcoming days to identify people who have entered India illegally and the consequence of the same would be the exclusion of only persons belonging to a particular religion that is Islam because other communities will be protected through this impugned act therefore it is direct and inevitable consequence of this impugned act which clearly violates article 14.</p><p><strong>Flouting the International Conventions</strong></p><p>This Act is also not in tune with plethora of international conventions to which India is a signatory. India is obligated to protect and preserve the basic human rights of every individual irrespective of his race; caste; sex; place of birth; political opinion and religion as per article 26 of International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights[ICCPR]. Article 6 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR] and Article 26 of ICCPR; however do not recognise the distinction between citizens and non citizens but they prohibit state from discriminating on the ground of religion. This Act providing fast track citizenship to non muslim illegal immigrants by way of naturalization and excluding the Muslims from acquiring the citizenship through same process is flagrant violation of article 26 and 6 of ICCPR and UDHR respectively.</p><p> <strong>Relief but no relief for the North Eastern States </strong></p><p>The impugned act is facing intense opposition in the North Eastern states of India especially in Assam because of the fears that the indigenous communities could get culturally and physically soaked by the illegal migrants (both Hindus and Muslims).The Assam Accord was signed in 1985 to assuage the festering feelings of the indigenous people of Assam because illegal immigrants were thronging the streets of the same therefore they had been given the assurance by the government to protect and preserve the local culture of the region by updating a National Register of Citizens to identify illegal immigrants and finally to deport them from where they came. But they have been betrayed by the government when this impugned act was passed which seeks to grant fast track citizenship to all those who have been persecuted in their home country irrespective of whether they have entered legally or illegally which is contrary to what was promised to them. The government also tried its best to appease the North Eastern states by exempting the region from the impugned act by invoking the provisions of Inner Line Permit and Sixth Schedule(Protected Tribal Areas) of the Indian Constitution.</p><p><strong>Deciphering the Inner Line Permit and Sixth Schedule</strong></p><p>Inner Line Permit is an official paper which stems from the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation which was put in place in 1873 by British Government and is required by the Indian citizens of other states to enter Arunachal Pradesh; Mizoram; and most of Nagaland. Manipur was also brought under Inner Line Permit with the passage of this impugned act to evade any kind of dissent.</p><p>The Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution envisages for autonomous decentralized self governance in certain tribal areas of Assam; Meghalaya and Tripura. In these areas communities not considered local are prohibited from owning land and doing any commercial businesses. Like the inner line permit in the post colonial era; the Sixth Schedule aims to protect the local tribal way of life.</p><p>But the so called exemption provided to the North Eastern states under Inner Line Permit is ineffective. It is quite obvious under ILP that anybody who is not indigenous can&#x2019;t settle down or buy any property in these regions. But The &#x2018;outsiders&#x2019; have always resided there by owning long term permits (by any means). This act also does not provide any provisions to abstain those people who have been naturalized by it from acquiring these inner line permits. Therefore; the exemption under ILP from the impugned Act are no concession but face saving devices for the BJP.</p><p>Unlike the Inner Line Permit; the areas under Sixth schedule are not clearly demarcated. The Sixth Schedule is a political project accompanied with the politics of identity and precious ideals of ethno-territoriality. These political considerations apparently override the realities. It is quiet easier to find out roads from one village which is outside the purview of Sixth Schedule into another village which is under the domain of the concerned Schedule .There are such numerous examples where this Schedule applies to only one side of the road and excludes the other side of the road which may further incentivize people to flock from one region to another region because there is no hindrance of plunging into those areas which fall outside the ambit of this schedule for getting the benefit of the impugned act. It is merely a charade of mitigating the simmering discontentment towards this act by giving them a placebo hope.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>This act is another step for accomplishing the long lasting aspirations of the right wing hindu nationalists which is to make this country a &#x2018;Hindu Rashtra&#x2019; and this impugned act is one of these several nefarious attempts which this country is seeing from the past several decades because this act gives precedence to other communities while at the same time excluding only one community from getting the benefit of the impugned act. It is the first attempt in the history of India when an act has been enacted to dismantle the secular fabric by granting citizenship on the basis of religion. It is bereft of any sound and plausible logic which vindicates that something sinister is going to be achieved through this impugned act. It also betrays the historical struggle and ambitions of the northeastern states. Now; it is on the Supreme Court (read executive court) to declare this legislation what it is that is patently unconstitutional.</p>, <strong>Mohd Malik Chauhan and Osama Noor. <br>B.A. LL.B 2<sup>nd</sup> year; Faculty of Law; Jamia Millia Islamia.</strong>, Normal, 22/01/2020

The chorus of Varun Grover&#x2019;s poem; <em>&#x2018;Hum kagaz naii dikhaengey&#x2019;; </em>became; through and through; the anthem of the protests.</p><p>While poetry continued to resound through protests; some of the musicians like; Rahul Negi a.k.a Madara who came up with <em>&#x2018;Tukde Tukde Gang&#x2019;;</em> Naqaab47 and shoals with;&#xA0; <em>&#x2018;Andolan&#x2019;</em> ; Gaurav Kadu&#x2019;s;<em> &#x2018;Bakre ki Amma&#x2019;; </em>which is a comic stand on the recent political unrest; and so many others; also contributed significantly to the nationwide resistance.</p><p><strong>From the Archives:</strong></p><p>From the echoing of age old slogan; <em>&#x2018;Inquilab</em> <em>Zindabad&#x2019;</em> to Faiz Ahmad Faiz&#x2019;s revolutionary poems; <em>&#x2018;Hum</em> <em>Dekhengey&#x2019;</em>; and <em>&#x2018;Bol ki lab aazad hain tere&#x2019;; </em>taking the lead; by breaking the shallow boundaries of divisive politics; we witnessed the resurfacing of literature; which became relevant for contemporary India.</p><p>Famous Urdu poet; Rahat Indori&#x2019;s; <em>&#x2018;Sabhi ka khoon hai shamil yahan ki mitti mai; kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai&#x2019;; called to the minds of those who have forgotten about the magnanimous history of India&#x2019;s freedom struggle. Habib Jalib&#x2019;s poem; &#x2018;Dastoor&#x2019;</em> marked its presence; while; <em>&#x2018;Mere seene maii nahi to tere seene mai sahi; ho kahin bhi aag lekin aag jalni chaiye&#x2019;;</em> by Dushyant Kumar kept the flame of dissent burning.</p><p><strong>The hues that echoed the call:</strong></p><p>The originating idea behind graffiti was finding platforms for free expression and creative rebellion. Students of Jamia Millia Islamia took forward this culture of &#x2018;mischievous art&#x2019; and brought alive their words by flamboyantly painting walls and roads; in and around campus.</p><p>A novel way of protesting that has emerged are <em>digital-doodles</em>. Minimalistic sketches with ample dialogues have took over the virtual world and are highly in vogue.</p><p>This unrest and commotion of bubbling images; also hold the ability to give an artistic and aesthetic attribute to the resistance.</p><p><strong>The &#x2018;Gen Z&#x2019; style:</strong></p><p>Think about the &#x2018;protest art&#x2019; and you are likely to imagine certain clich&#xE9;s from the bygone era.

They became the reflection of democratic values; just with a humorous approach. Internet is flooded with memes taking a dig at the BJP government and the political duo of Modi-Shah.

Instagram stories and Facebook posts proliferated opinions faster than fire. This is the new generation&#x2019;s way of showing its criticism for the oppressive measures of the current government.</p><p>As creative and intellectual exposure unfurl; the art of protesting has metamorphosed; evolving into a form which is to become the testimony to the genius of dissenter today; the ingenuity in their approaches of resenting in such tumultuous times prove that the protester is an artist.</p><p>India is seeing an innovative revival amid the anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests.

BOJACK HORSEMAN – SAD OR HONEST?, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/do-not-touch.png?w=560&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>While the final season (part 2); airing 31<sup>st</sup> January 2020; of BoJack Horseman looms upon our heads; it is about time we tear apart this beautiful animated series to see just how well it deals with many issues of our daily lives in the most fun and humorous manner &#x2013; all in all with a gut wrenching honesty. It is time to search for the answer of the most important question; i.e.; &#x201C;<strong>Is BoJack Horseman just painfully sad or overwhelmingly honest?</strong>&#x201D;</em></p><p>Television has become a simulator through which human beings try to escape their own reality. Television provides human beings with the option to choose to divulge themselves into another reality with characters and story-line(s) and thereby the option to push aside their own life and their own issues. But would you watch a work of art that would very outrightly deal with these issues that you push aside to get some peace of mind? Would you watch something that very much slaps these issues right back into your face in the most genuine way possible?&#xA0;</p><p>BoJack Horseman is an American adult animated comedy-drama Netflix original series created by <strong>Raphael Bob-Waksberg</strong> and it casts stars like <strong>Will Arnett</strong> (voicing the title character); <strong>Amy Sedaris</strong> (voicing Princess Carolyn); <strong>Alison Brie</strong> (voicing Diane Nguyen); <strong>Paul F. Tompkins</strong> (voicing Mr. Peanutbutter) and <strong>Aaron Paul</strong> (voicing Todd Chavez). The show tells the story of BoJack Horseman; a horse who is a washed-up Hollywood superstar and now leads a lonely and troubled life after starring in a hit TV show called &#x201C;Horsin&#x2019; Around.&#x201D; The show&#x2019;s universe is a complex and tricky one as it has all kinds of animals and fishes with humanlike characteristics and also has humans within the same universe. The title character; as mentioned before; is a horse with humanlike characteristics who can talk and feel things like a normal human being. BoJack&#x2019;s best friend Todd Chavez is a human being and is also BoJack&#x2019;s roommate. Whereas; BoJack&#x2019;s agent; and friend; Princess Carolyn; is a cat. Diane Nguyen is also a human being and is a ghostwriter. Diane&#x2019;s husband Mr. Peanutbutter is a dog and also a Hollywood superstar like BoJack.</p><p>The show starts off as a subpar animated comedy show in the first season and introduces us to the current life of BoJack Horseman after his show has ended and how being a Hollywood superstar affects his daily life. At first the show seems like just an ordinary show that is trying its best at being funny and comical and perhaps a little sarcastic in tone but as soon as you finish with the first season the show brings in a whole new perspective and doesn&#x2019;t refrain from outrightly stunning you with the way it aims at taboo topics. The show carefully tackles issues like loneliness; failing careers; anxiety; depression; heartbreaks; etc. whilst managing to deliver on-the-nose humor and wit. The first half of the first season was not welcomed with open arms but the latter half of the season blew minds and that is when the show saw a boom in its popularity and got on the success train.</p><p>Most of the famous episodes of the series are from the last 3 seasons with <strong>Time&#x2019;s Arrow (Season 4; Episode 11)</strong> being the most loved episode of the whole series and <strong>Free Churro (Season 5; Episode 6)</strong> being the second most loved. Time&#x2019;s Arrow delivers us a look at the story of Beatrice Sugarman (BoJack&#x2019;s abusive mother) and how her life turned upside down after she met Butterscotch Horseman (BoJack&#x2019;s father) and had their son BoJack. The episode shows us the life of Beatrice and how all her dreams were crushed and how she had to go through so many traumatic incidents in her childhood and even in her teenager years. Free Churro is an episode which delivers an extraordinary amount of insight into BoJack&#x2019;s own life and his mother&#x2019;s all in nothing but a simple and plain monologue delivered by BoJack himself at his mother&#x2019;s funeral. The monologue goes on for the whole runtime of the episode and shows us the true power this show has and how the writers have beautifully utilized their ability to tackle such sad and stigmatic issues head-on whilst maintaining to sprinkle humor and wit here and there throughout the episode. BoJack talks about freedom; his father; his mother; Hollywood; himself; existence and empathy throughout the episode. One of the most important dialogue from the whole monologue is; &#x201C;<em>Usually when people ask how I&#x2019;m doing; the real answer is I&#x2019;m doing shitty; but I can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m doing shitty; because I don&#x2019;t even have a good reason to be doing shitty. So; if I say; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m doing shitty;&#x201D; then they say; &#x201C;Why? What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D; And I have to be like; &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know; all of it?&#x201D; So instead; when people ask me how I&#x2019;m doing; I usually say; &#x201C;I am doing so great.</em>&#x201C;&#x201D;</p><p>In conclusion; BoJack Horseman brings in a new wave of television to television and instead of being categorized as a sad show it pushes itself to be categorized as a show which is open and honest and deals with life in the most genuine form all the while maintaining it&#x2019;s potential to grow and change.</p>, <strong>Yusuf Aziz </strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) English; Jamia Millia Islamia </strong>, Normal, 20/01/2020 
A Midnight Consultation, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/whatsapp-image-2020-01-12-at-7.35.22-pm.jpeg?w=851&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>As another day passes with the ongoing struggle to even protest; some questions would normally arise in a half sane mind. Something on the lines of when men are given guns to protect; who do they choose to use the guns against or any weapon of so called defense for that matter? This is a conversation between two vulnerable ideals- a student and democracy- both unsure of the answer.</em></p><p>I&#x2019;ve put a picture of democracy in front of me; it&#x2019;s your average mature lady; painted in different shades; holding a sickle in one hand and thresher in another. She has eyes encircled with black charcoal; if you look closer it becomes a beggars bowl; held out in anticipation. Outside my hostel room; it&#x2019;s a mixture of cold and chaos. Our professors; seniors or any &#x201C;scholars&#x201D; for that matter have left the campus in the hands of this miscellaneous atmosphere. Education has taken a pause. But I have questions to ask outside of my lecture hall; I have thoughts emerging in my mind during these politically volatile times that need to be attended to.&#xA0; So I have decided to have a conversation with this lady in front of my eyes; A dialogue of sorts.</p><p>&#x201C;Who do you represent?&#x201D; She asks me. I tell her &#x201C;The truth&#x201D;; both my answer and assertion. We look at each other with suspicious eyes; as history has taught us both to see this way. She settles her brows slowly into wedged tension less lines. So I go on with my questions; I tell her I have been alone. I have grown to see borders and barbed wires between houses of the common and the uniformed. She tells me &#x201C;but barbed wires keep out intruders&#x201D;. I sigh and let her know that they come at us with such sharp lines to keep our foot from stepping into their territories. &#x201C;Oh you must be carrying an unsafe object in your hands; your feet must be ridden with blades?&#x201D;&#xA0; She tells me.&#xA0; &#x201C;No&#x201D; I reply.&#xA0; &#x201C;We only come holding papers in our hands; an old revolutionary&#x2019;s poetry on our lips.&#x201D; &#x201C;What do you point at them then?&#x201D; she naively asks me and I tell her &#x201C;our chests&#x201D;.</p><p>She sees my hand rolled into a fist and asks me how as a student I hold a pen? &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t write often anymore&#x201D; I tell her. &#x201C;It is a ball of fear that I am holding inside of my hands; a slogan pitched at me from a reddened path by my comrades taking shelter from canisters of gas. We&#x2019;ve all held it in&#x201D; I whisper to her. Democracy eyes me down; funnels her words into a well known phrase. &#x201C;Oh but they protect you. They wear our lands khaki on their shoulders; they would never betray any color of the flag&#x201D; &#x201C;The flag&#x2019;s being repainted&#x201D; I tell her. She refuses to hear the color. Democracy sits in silence with me; I offer her tea; as she tells me her throat is dry. I push aside my sketches of Kashmir to let her breathe a little. Democracy feels anxious in my hostel room.</p><p>&#x201C;Why did you call me here?&#x201D; She jabs at me.&#xA0; &#x201C;To ask questions&#x201D; I soothingly reply. &#x201C;Be done with it then&#x201D; The uneasy democracy says to me. So I grab my phone and use it to show her my modernly acquired evidences. Her charcoal circles shut themselves up at the sight of broken heads and blinded eyes. &#xA0;&#x201C;They can be doctored&#x201D; and as she says this I no longer feel surprised at democracy; she has given in too; her words have too been thrown into the machine and sieved through carefully vandalized thoughts. So I with all my years old sigh; ask her one last time &#x201C;Who does democracy protect anymore?&#x201D; She slowly crawls back into the 6&#xD7;6 canvas lying unorganized on my desk.</p><p>In my quest to find the answers; democracy too falls short. There is a slight murmur in the air tonight again; that we&#x2019;ll be going to sleep unprotected in our hostel rooms. That lathis and khakis are no longer peaceful. They can barge in anytime.&#xA0; I lay back in my rectangular bed too short for me to fit in and look at my poorly painted democracy with the same questions in both our eyes- &#x201C;Who protects us anymore?&#x201D;</p>", <strong>Babra Shafiqi</strong> <br><strong>BA (Hons) English; Jamia MIllia Islamia</strong>, Normal, 12/01/2020 
The Other Side: CAA & NRC in Retrospection, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/20200117_203107_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>Every coin has two sides and so does the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 and National Register of Citizens. With the utter rage created amongst the people of India due to social influence and mass protest going on in the country; the other side of CAA and NRC might be getting glossed over.</em> <em>Here&#x2019;s a retrospective look at the CAA &amp; NRC proceedings with another side in addendum. </em></p><p>During the proceedings in the Parliament; the Minister of Home Affairs; Mr. Amit Shah; said in his introductory speech for Citizenship Amendment Bill (now an Act) on 11th December; 2019 that &#x2018;persecuted minorities in Pakistan; Bangladesh and Afghanistan will get citizenship in India under this Act.&#x2019; These words surely show concern about humanity; however the amendment goes without the word &#x2018;persecuted&#x2019;. Moreover; had the persecution been ceased after 31st December 2014 in the aforesaid three countries? This criteria is violation of Article 14 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights as persecution is not done date-wise. On 10th January 2020; CAA has come into force as per the notification from the Ministry of Home Affairs. This means those non-Muslims in Assam who were stripped down from their citizenship after the Assam-NRC would acquire back their status.<br>Furthermore; not only is there a Citizenship Amendment Act but also a proposed nation-wide NRC; i.e.; National Register of Citizens. On 20th June 2019; President Ram Nath Kovind addressed both NRC and CAA in a joint sitting of both the houses of Parliament. In NRC; if the documents (unspecified as of yet) of a current Indian citizen falls short then they will be termed as illegal immigrants irrespective of their religion; caste; creed; age; race; etc. As CAA comes with pan-India NRC; likewise citizens/illegal immigrants will be queued to get themselves registered and out of the queue there will be many who will be termed as &#x2018;illegal&#x2019;. You would ask why; does CAA not provide them citizenship? The answer to that is no; it does not! To get citizenship under CAA; one needs to prove that he/she does not belong to India and rather an illegal immigrant from Pakistan; Bangladesh or Afghanistan.<br>National Register of Citizens and Citizenship Amendment Act aren&#x2019;t the only two knots on this string; there is another knot that has commenced its work in the country; i.e.; the National Population Register (NPR). Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on 22nd December 2019 in his rally that there has been no discussion on a nation-wide NRC except of Assam. Although; NPR has a link with nation-wide NRC as per the questions answered (Starred &#x2013; Q. No. 229: Integrating Aadhar Card Project with NPR of 23rd July 2014 and Q.

No. 4583: Progress of NPR of 8th May 2013) by the Ministry of Home Affairs at Rajya Sabha website. However; there is Unstarred Q. No. 4583: Progress of NPR of 8th May 2013 which carries the same link. There is a statement of former Prime Minister; Dr. Manmohan Singh of 18th December 2003 in Parliament proceedings which is as follows &#x2013; &#x201C;I would like to point out that with regard to the treatment of refugees after the Partition of our country; the minorities in countries like Bangladesh; have faced persecution; and it is our moral obligation that if circumstances force people; these unfortunate people; to seek refuge in our country; our approach to granting citizenship to these unfortunate persons should be more liberal. I sincerely hope that the hon. Deputy Prime Minister (the then Shri L.K. Advani) will bear this in mind in charting out the future course of action with regard to the Citizenship Act.&#x201D; The BJP-led government claims it to be an idea of previous Congress government. There is no mention of the word &#x2018;refugee&#x2019; in the Act as such BJP is claiming on the basis of Dr. Manmohan Singh&#x2019;s aforementioned statement neither a religious identity was attached to it. <br>In order to defy these three; protests are happening throughout the nation to convey to the government that these must be withdrawn which are unconstitutional and inhuman as they are a direct violation of Preamble of the Indian Constitution and Article 15 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Even Nobel laureate; Amartya Sen has told reporters in Bengaluru at the Infosys Science Foundation&#x2019;s Infosys Prize 2019 that one cannot have certain type of fundamental human rights linking citizenship with religious differences. NRC proved to be a failure in the state of Assam as many illegal migrants were categorized as citizens due to the documents they possessed; through unfair means; and many citizens were categorized as illegal migrants due to lack of documents. Moreover; the Indian Economy is in a constant decline with the GDP falling from 5% in Q1 to 4.5% in Q2 of 2019-2020. The unemployment rate is the highest in at least forty-five years. There is also a steep decline in foreign funds in Telecom; Pharmaceuticals and; Power in 2018-2019; and $3 Billion is the total economic cost of net bans (2012-2017; all states). The implementation of these laws will further cost crores and crores of rupees.<br>As the protests go on throughout the country; there are bound to be supporters of these Acts and the Government. Those who are in favour of these laws are either not fully aware of these laws or are supporting to save their interests. Police invest their time to disperse these protests and to stop them from happening; willingly or not; only to save their own livelihood. One point of support is also seen from this side which says (repealing Article 14 of the Constitution of India from their minds) the Act as constitutional because the Constitution of India applies only on existing Indian citizens.<br>After what these CAA-defenders have tried is definitely not what state of Kerala has done. On 14th January 2020; Kerala becomes the first state to challenge CAA in Supreme Court under Article 131 and its petition suggestive of violation of Articles 14; 21 and 25 of the Constitution of India by the Act. On 22nd January 2020; the Supreme Court is going to hear all the petitions. Moreover; the Punjab government passed an Anti-CAA Resolution ensuing one by Kerala. With continually increasing Nation wide protests and stark opposition in political and popular front. Will this be CAA&#x2019;s endgame? Let&#x2019;s see.</p>", <strong><em>Nabiha Fatima; B. Com.

Once a Kingdom of Books; now abodes Screams and Horrors, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/20191229_135049_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><strong><em>A silent spectator that houses multitude continually envisioned to protect knowledge and progress through the shelter and nurture that it offers has served millions since it&#x2019;s inception; but the same couldn&#x2019;t withstand the harbingers of ignorance that attacked it ruthlessly on a cold winter night. Dr. Zakir Hussain Library retells the account the night and the horrors it withstood through one of its readers. </em></strong></p><p>When the library of Alexandria started to lose its significance; its when rulers saw its knowledge as a peril rather than pride. Libraries are often seen as silent hosts for the people who seem to rote entire academic manuscripts into their brains.<br>A library is a refuge to many like me; where silence is peaceful and the wanderers of text often come home to a place which has books and knowledge to cater to. Where else do you go when the world is too noisy?<br>I have been one of those people who will be seen; sitting in one corner of the library. The one who likes to know anything till deep; with a heavy bag of books; the library card reserved and is always sipping <em>chai</em> while browsing through books The library is no less than a home to me; much like my university.</p><p><br>Dr Zakir Husain Library was established in 1920; and is named after the third President of India and former Vice-Chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia; His Excellency The Honorable Dr Zakir Hussain. As  one of the founders of Jamia Millia Islamia; he was one of the profound thinkers who worked relentlessly for the cause of education and development of this country.</p><p><br>The library; whose name itself is the metaphor for inclusive thoughts is built on ideal foundations; was attacked mercilessly by the very same state machinery which was supposed to protect it. <br>On 15th December 2019; following the protests against the Central forces; the Delhi Police allegedly barged inside the premises of Jamia Millia Islamia and started shellacking the students present inside the campus. As they entered through the University gates pushing the guards aside; they stepped inside the Ibn Sina (Old) Reading Hall; the textbooks and research centre adjacent to Premchand Archives section and went further towards the New Reading Hall &amp; Central Library to perform what they seemed to be there for; giving sleepless nights for the beholders and many else to those who need it. <br>The worst part; however; remains that the students present in the reading halls and library weren&#x2019;t even a part of the protest and were actually just studying there; while they were locked; thrashed; handled and abused for a crime that they seem to be skeptical about! More than 20 students were detained from the same place which through the years had nurtured and given to the society some of its most influential and intellectual workers.<br>Tear gas smokes circulated inside the library and reading halls while they were inhabited by hundreds of students. </p><p><br>The smoke is still there; as the closed gates for inquiry and broken glasses store memories that has traumatised students; who have not just sustained physical injuries but also grave mental ones.<br>I was not there; I was inside my home; safe and sound; but I could hear the gunshots and explosions late till 9 pm. I still remember the panic-stricken voice of my friends and the frantic messages on university groups that I am a part of.<br>There was only one appeal; it was to escape.<br>And then the media did its deed; the photos and videos started circulating; and the destroyed structure of my library and reading rooms came to surface. It was heartbreaking.<br>I saw the Old Library broken where I have dozed off while studying &#x201C;Burmese Days&#x201D;<br>They broke a chair on which I read &#x201C;Farheniet 451&#x201D;.<br>The stairs where I cried were all laid by the glasses that adorned Zakir Hussain Library.<br>The place where I soaked the sun in the winters of Delhi; the places where I studied. They attacked the places where I sat with my friends. They attacked the places where I read and cried and smiled through the books. They attacked the places where I slept through the exhausting routine. They attacked my memories. They attacked my home.<br>The testimonies of victims; who were my friends; beloved seniors and acquaintances very well stated the intention of the police that night.<br>It wanted to kill them.<br>It wanted to silence them permanently for speaking against their masters.<br>No permission; no process and unending brutality.<br>15 December was the Black day for Jamia Millia Islamia and Dr Zakir Hussain Library; which does not only has books and artefacts but the aspirations of the young; what they &#x201C;future of this country.&#x201D;</p><p><br><br>They might state officially that they did not enter the library; but the cost of lies is always heavy. The technology does not discriminate; because the evidence and testimonies speak otherwise.<br>As I write this; I feel heavy with the burden to pass on the trauma that I did not experience forehand but my friends did. All I was nothing but the witness to sounds that made their way to me; from one home to another.<br>From then on; I could not sleep.<br>I was in constant fear; they might attack again and this time; to my own home. They have destroyed my library; now they will destroy this one too.<br>But; our broken glasses and harrowing screams has reached every corner of the world.<br>From some local dailies to the international ones; everyone reported the brutality of police around the world. The entire capital and the Nation and world stood with us; every other institution stood with us because our library was a symbol of state-sanctioned violence and students felt the same insecurity as the victims.<br>The images are horrifying; the campus is empty and yet you can still see the remnants of the glasses and stones from the outside.<br>The state that fears its wise young voices is doomed to fall; the citizens are not subject; you are not a king. The government is not a nation; it&#x2019;s the nation that has built this government.<br>You may give roses to the one that broke my home; but it has lost my trust; as I feel unsafe yet secure in this paradoxical politics; ironical leaders and the great Union of India; those who are striving hard for justice are the true heroes that the world shall remember. </p>, <strong><em>MANTASHA SAYED; B.A. (Hons.)

SOCIAL MEDIA- A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/20200102_173212_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>At the turn of 20th century; Facebook was born and so were the many first-time student protestors lining up the streets today to protest against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Registration of Indian Citizens (NRIC). While; student protestors of Jamia Millia Islamia University took to the streets to raise their concerns; another group of students worked tirelessly behind the curtains. The latter group ensured that there was a steady flow of posts and information regarding the ongoing protests. Courtesy to Instagram; Whatsapp; and Facebook likeminded people and dissidents were able to organise and take collective action; which Turkish sociologist Zeynep Tufekci calls the &#x2018;information cascade&#x2019;.</em><br>The formidability of social media came to light when on 15th December; within a matter of a few hours post the brutality and barbarism of Delhi Police on the students of Jamia; a huge crowd gathered in front of the headquarters of Delhi Police at ITO demanding the release of detained students. These were not just students of Jamia Millia Islamia University but also students of Jawaharlal Nehru University; Delhi University; IP University and the locals. Probably; three decades back; this level of collectivisation of people and spread of information in such a short span of time would not have been possible. The spine chilling event of 15th December in which one student lost his eye; innocent students who were not even protesting were mercilessly beaten; and subjected to psychological and verbal assault acted as a &#x2018;tipping point&#x2019;. The police brutality could not drown the voice of the protesting students. The undeterred students rose stronger; more determined to fight against the unconstitutional and discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act.<br>Social media has played an important role since the fateful day of 15th December with posts not only spreading information about the schedule of protests but also criticising mute onlookers until their conscience screams at them. Born in 2004; Facebook was created to serve a coterie of elite students but now social media platforms have become mainstream. Whatsapp alone has 400 million users in India; which once again reiterates its formidability and fragility. In the era of information; where data is the new oil; the question arises that whether social media needs a watchdog. People have figured out ways to doctor videos and manipulate information thereby giving the narrative a 360-degree spin.</p><p><br>Many fake posts; doctored videos have been circulating; which are not only misleading but also incendiary depict how powerful and dangerous social media can be. A fake post; which includes 4 pictures of one of the student protestors; Ayesha Renna; claimed that she has been protesting in different cities. All the photographs in the post were taken in New Delhi hence debunking the post as fake. Another post with a photograph of policemen with head injuries went viral on social media claiming that anti-CAA protestors have caused it. This claim is also false as the image has been in circulation since 2018. In the midst of fake news and rumours; a student at Jamia Millia Islamia University recorded a video depicting how easy it is to spread fake news and tamper with someone&#x2019;s Facebook posts.</p><p><br>In the online world; social media sits on the thin line between private and public space. Fake news; tampered videos; rumours make one ponder whether we need a watchdog for social media. However; as one question leads to another; we may ask how will it be ensured that the watchdog will not become a moral policing agency? In the digital space; as it is said; &#x201C;Nothing gets deleted completely and everyone is naked&#x201D; who will ensure that the Right to Privacy of citizens is not violated? In addition; with the Citizenship Amendment Act and the newly tabled Data Protection Bill is the Indian State becoming Orwellian?<br>We may not have found satisfactory answers to such questions but we need to realize what we can do as individuals and politically active citizens of this country to curb the spread of fake news.</p>, <strong><em>MARYAM AHMED; B.A.(HONS) ENGLISH; JAMIA MILLIA ISLAMIA</em></strong>, Normal, 02/01/2020 
Political Apathy: Why a Necessity?, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/20200105_195808_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>Choosing to remain deaf to the ongoing political revolutions in the country doesn&#x2019;t make you apolitical but in turn puts you on the side of the oppressor rather. In this modern world; where every decision that&#x2019;s made has a political conottation; pretending to be serene by unjust laws being passed in the country counts as nothing but political gaslighting; especially when the affected has shared most of the existence with you. </em></p><p>&#x201C;It was shocking and to a great extent; hurtful to see my friends uploading stories of their meals; birthdays and other things while my varsity was vandalized&#x201D;<br>&#x201C;I spent a night in terror. They didn&#x2019;t even call me to ask me how I was; instead argued with me offline and online.&#x201D;<br>&#x201C;My friends who belong to majoritarian identity are silent. Its as if they don&#x2019;t care.&#x201D;</p><p>Many of us may find ourselves relating to these personal anecdotes. Undoubtedly; the youth led movement against the draconian law has paved its way into the personal lives of youngsters all over the country; causing fall outs and conflicts in friendships due to ideological differences and a difference in political opinions. While the majority of the youth is out on the streets expressing their dissent over the regressive law; there is a huge section of youth following the &#x2018;ostrich-burying-their-head&#x2019; approach; choosing not to comment on the happenings around them; even if it affects their friends from marginalized sections of society.<br>It is not new for the urban middle and upper class to follow the trend of being apolitical; a term which literally means &#x2018;having no interest or involvement in political affairs&#x2019;; or &#x2018;having an aversion to politics or political affairs&#x2019;. However; it&#x2019;s a luxury few can afford. Those who choose to look away have the privilege to do so; because their existence isn&#x2019;t &#x2018;politicised&#x2019; for them-their socioeconomic backgrounds; gender or race allows them to live a life in which they will most likely not be a target of bigotry; systemic oppression; bullying; attacks or deportation. However; not everyone can afford to be this lackadaisical and disengaged- the recent JNU fee hikes that retracts the opportunity for education from weaker sections of society; the police brutality on the students of Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University and the regressive anti-muslim law have caused many that are directly affected by these to pour out on the streets to express their dissent over destruction of the secular fabric of the nation and the essence of the Preamble; which provides &#x201C;Equality of Opportunity&#x201D; to all.</p><p><br>For the indian youth; seeing politics as a topic of &#x2018;interest&#x2019; or &#x2018;non-interest&#x2019;; saying &#x201C;indian politics is a mess and I don&#x2019;t want to be a part of it&#x201D; is a privilege reveal in itself; stemming from the benefits they reap by simply sitting high up on the pyramid of entitlement. Those who choose to go about their lives ignoring these struggles are the ones who have largely benefited from class structures in society and more often than not; it&#x2019;s their &#x2018;apathy&#x2019; rather that political neutrality. Its the choice to remain ignorant except for the exceptional cases where people choose to create an echo chamber simply because it is triggering or affects their mental health. They decidedly or unconsciously become desensitized and uninterested; sitting high up on the hierarchical pyramid; all the while being enraged when the protests led by the disenfranchised disrupts their everyday life.<br>A chunk of the cafe-going; retail therapy loving generation stays silent around people that say things that are sexist; homophobic; casteist; classist or xenophobic; simply because it&#x2019;s &#x2018;not their business&#x2019;. They fear isolation and the possibility of being attacked online or lose a portion of their social media following. In turn; they actively perpetuate these bigoted ideas and cultures by not calling them out. The other chunk calls them out to break out of the fool&#x2019;s paradise of apoliticism and understand that every choice they make is political. The ongoing civil resistance has seen youngsters call out their peers; classmates and friends who are so much out of the realm of reality that they cannot empathise with peers who have their lives at stake.</p><p>We all have heard of the famous quote by Desmond Tutu that goes; &#x201C;if you are neutral in times of injustice; you have already chosen the side of the oppressor.&#x201D; Every single decision that we make is political. We are never as neutral as we wish to be- politics follows all of us; regardless of our earnest desire to look the other way. With the universities and its youngsters remaining as the last line of resistance to the complete fascist takeover of the country; choosing to stay apolitical is a political stance that only supports and encourages the state&#x2019;s assault and the injustice unleashed on its citizens.</p>, <strong><em>SANIA ANSARI; B.A. (HONS.)

Khaki is the New Fear, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/img-20200116-wa0038.jpg?w=851&h=312&crop=1," <p class=""has-text-align-center has-normal-font-size""><em>The very &#x2018;guardians of law&#x2019; took a monstrous form in <strong>Uttar Pradesh</strong> as the police maneuvered in establishing a soul stirring example of brutality by targeting the Muslim dominated areas of the state.</em></p><p>For the past two months; India has been seemingly swallowed up in the historic fire of the biggest nationwide protests in over four decades. The draconian bill; CAA <strong>(Citizenship Amendment Act)</strong>; which is evidently the purveyor of the divisive ideology of &#x2018;<em>one nation; one religion</em>&#x2019; has been widely condemned by the most powerful entity of a nation; the people. The bill is believed to be clearly hosting a fascistic tendency and undoubtedly rips apart the secular fabric of the Indian Constitution. However; the dissent didn&#x2019;t go down so well with the <strong>Prime Minister Narendra Modi</strong>; and his <strong>Hindu Nationalist BJP Government</strong>. It met with blatant repression; with authorities imposing <strong>Section 144</strong>; and the police using batons and firing tear gas openly on the demonstrators.</p><p class=""has-normal-font-size"">The brutalities of the police and its ruthlessness shuddered <strong>Uttar Pradesh</strong>; more than any other region; as the state witnessed the highest death toll and the most intense police crackdowns. According to several accounts given to the media by the victims; police in the state is in the circle of many allegations : violence against the student protesters of the <strong>Aligarh Muslim University</strong>; attacking peaceful crowds with <em>lathis; </em>tear-gas and bullets; beating Muslim bystanders on the street; raiding and looting Muslim homes while raising Islamophobic slurs; detaining and torturing Muslim children. The allegations further includes filing criminal charges against Muslims who had never been to the protest.</p><p class=""has-normal-font-size""><strong>Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh; Yogi Adityanath</strong> said the government will take revenge from those people who damaged public property during protests against CAA. &#x201C;<em>They have been captured in video and CCTV footage. We will take badla (revenge) from them&#x2019;</em>; he said. And; the order seems to have come from the top. In <strong>Muzzafarnagar</strong>; the affect of the police brutality went on to an even higher degree and a series of unfortunate events unfolded on 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> December. The trouble began when a peaceful demonstration turned violent as police tried to thrash the protesters. Vehicles were lit on fire and stones were pelted; this led to the police open firing on the crowd. The police allegedly searched for the people who took part in the protest; entered the nearby <strong>Sadat Madrasa</strong> (orphanage); and started destroying everything on their way. <strong>Maulana Azad Raza Hussaini</strong> (66); and 35 of his students; 15 of whom were below 18 and mostly orphans; were taken to the nearby police barracks. Here; the cleric was stripped of his clothes and was brutally beaten; whilst the students were tortured using bamboo sticks; causing rectal bleeding.</p><p class=""has-normal-font-size"">According to multiple reports; the late night raids on Muslim homes; carried out in Muzzafarnagar and across the state. Over those two days; women; children; elderly; were not spared of the repercussions of police brutality. Similarly on December 19<sup>th</sup>; at least three people were hit by bullets during a protest against CAA; in <strong>Hussainabad</strong>. Two of those people were teenage boys who were just stuck between the violence occurring at the protest. Muslim residents of the area alleged that the police raided and vandalized their homes while beating several people. On December 20<sup>th</sup>; police in <strong>Meerut</strong> smashed the windows and doors of shops&#xA0;and destroyed vehicles in the Muslim dominated areas.</p><p class=""has-normal-font-size"">Two families in <strong>Nazia Sarai</strong> area of <strong>Bijnor</strong>; claimed that the police entered their homes; vandalized and looted their home and also threatened to sexually assault one of the women. In <strong>Bijnor&#x2019;s Nagina Town</strong>; the police arrested at least 100 people for alleged violence; 15 of them minors; the youngest being 13 years old. The children told <strong>The</strong> <strong>Huffington Post</strong><em> </em>that they were physically abused in police custody for almost 48 hours. On the very same day; in <strong>Varanasi</strong>; police violence led to a stampede; that left 11 year old <strong>Sagir Ahmad</strong>; crushed to death. He was not a part of the protest but just happened to be there. The District Magistrate of Varanasi said; &#x201C;such things keeps happening&#x201D;; mocking the child&#x2019;s death. In <strong>Firozabad</strong>; 30 year old buffalo seller; <strong>Mohd. Haroon</strong>; was shot on his neck by a bullet fired by an unknown person. He died in the <strong>AIIMS Trauma Centre</strong>; <strong>Delhi</strong>; on December 26<sup>th</sup>. </p><p class=""has-normal-font-size"">These are but fragments of the rampant violence and barbarism that has choked the very essence of humanity and the principles on which the foundation of this nation is modeled. The discordant and fanatic mentality manifested itself in the unconstitutional handling of the dissent; in the recent stroke of nationwide protests; which is not just morally shallow and inhumane; but also a testimony of our democratic framework being strangled at the hands of an authoritarian and absolute form of governance.</p>", <p><em><strong>NUZHAT KHAN; BA (HONS.)

When they Stand; She leads them, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/img-20191225-wa0018.jpg?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>The recent streak of protests in the varsity; provided a centre for nationwide movement against CAA and proposed NRC; but apart from the augmentation the protests will be marked for its leadership that was manifested in the women of the University. The Girls of JMI; did not only actively participate in the protests but at many instances led the crowd to shake the authorities and break stereotypes that were built around them. </em></p><p>Even in the 21st Century; it is not very surprising to come across inveterate stereotypes established around women; and that of Jamia Millia Islamia are no different to it. The common perception about them is one of stubborn conventions: supposedly powerless and oppressed; all of them veiled; demure and largely apolitical silent figures; which not only reduces these women to a stereotyped singularity; but also plasters a handy cultural icon over much more complicated historical and political dynamics. However; the realization can only be drawn when a walk around the campus gives you sights of a palette of women with some tying their laces for sports practice; to some adjusting their robes for Moot courts; those who are carrying Arundhati Roy &amp; Alice Walkers; to those who are arguing about the leadership of Margaret Thatcher &amp; Theresa May. It&#x2019;s not shocking at all to witness such strong inculcation of leadership skills and values at a place where keynote positions from Chancellor; <em>Vice Chancellor;</em> Dean of Students Welfare; Heads of Department(s) ; Club Conveners &amp; Secretaries to Class Representatives and various other responsibilities are held by women with perfection. </p><p>In the wake of the recent protest; we found female students of Jamia taking lead against the authoritarian excesses; while they ventured forward to save the country from the very guardians in the world&#x2019;s largest democracy.  Girls who have become the face of the Jamia protests after a video of three girls standing strong to the baton weilding police personnel went viral on the internet; received wide attention from people all across the world. </p><p>It was only after the residents of the J&amp;K Girls Hostel &amp; Begum Hazrat Mahal Girls Hostel voiced their opinions about the Citizenship Amendment Act &amp; National Register for Citizens; the protest gathered a significant support from the entire university. Each day more people joined the protests and an exponential amount of girls from various departments; faculties and centres associated themselves as the movement went further. </p><p>I was to leave for her home after the winter break; but now after witnessing so much wrong against  and in the country; I won&#x2019;t go home. </p><p>says a student from Department of Economics; Jamia Millia Islamia</p><p>She will stay back and fight for them and their common tenets. Not only this; but women from all age groups; including the grandmothers and sisters of Jamia students took an active part in the ongoing protest. A few women; in their 60s; almost limped to the site of protest; while some accompanied their family members and friends.</p><p>A sight that I am proud to have beholden was; female students from diverse medical fields who were residing in the hostel; relentlessly providing first aids; and medical care to the wounded students who took shelter in the hostel; saving them from the mishaps that were ongoing in the university. </p><p>The teachers surely proved to be the motivating force for the students be it from the Jamia Teachers Association (JTA) or female professors in specific who didn&#x2019;t even hesitate to lie down on roads for the sake of the nation; this itself is a testimony of their courage and strength and can perhaps never be forgotten. Such was the splendor of women surging out to fight against the injustice.</p><p>This time we saw the women of Jamia tearing down the misconceptions hoisted around them bit-by-bit; as they resisted and fought the despotic act with equal strength and avidity. The gusto with which female students of the university are trying to spread the cause; both through words and actions; proves that staying silent is the last thing on the table. A student who was a part of the protest since day one said; &#x201C;<em>I; as a woman; felt stronger than I ever was. I went on the road; with several other girls like me; we were fighting there; we were standing tall against all odds; that made me proud of us all.</em>&#x201C;</p><p>This one unfortunate incident definitely established the fact that women are in no way weak or oppressed; they are a symbol of power and the fuel for the progress of a society.

We shall resist, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/20191217_163633_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p>At times when we felt anxious; when our hearts ached and pounded irregularly; we would go for a stroll inside the campus. Mostly; during the nights; we went; and sat on a green bench to contemplate the things around. The beautiful shadows; old buildings; the lush green lawns and libraries filled with students working hard with some objective in their minds; some dreamt of writing a book; others of building a home. It calmed us down like no other thing ever could. Jamia not only provides education; it is a refuge; and a home for ailing hearts to find peace. It does not ask about your identity but embraces you without discrimination.</p><p><br>On 15th December; when we were in our apartment; our friend Rabia was studying inside the reading room. She was stuck along with some other students; while those goons were unleashing unimaginable terror on whatever they came across. The police broke through; despite the failed attempts by students to block them by using desks as barricades they placed in front of the entry.</p><p><br>They barged in; destroyed the surveillance cameras; and targeted the boys. While they were busy breaking bones; some girls out there pleaded and tried their best to rescue them from their clenches. Some of the students were brutally injured and needed immediate intervention. The library was engulfed in wails; and those who were not wailing lay traumatised; and kept looking at the floor. On noticing a particular student gasping hard for breath; and almost on the verge of closing his eyes; and foam spilling out from his mouth; she leapt into action. She tried to keep him awake; slapped him; blocked his nose; and tried everything that she could. For him to survive; he needed to be taken to a hospital. She dragged him all along; with the help of some other students; through the corridor; pleading the policemen to let them through. At some points; she begged for her way; while at others she asked them to fuck off. Once at the road; not a single car stopped to help the injured person. They boarded a car only to be kicked out after not even travelling a mile. They finally managed to take him to a hospital where he was immediately declared to be very critical. Rabia retuned to the flat after a few hours. She had hurt her ankle; and had no energy left in her even to walk. She was accompanied by some boy; named Umar (name changed); still in his teenage; shivering and frightened out of wits. He was not a student of Jamia but accessed the library to prepare for his NEET examination. He could not close his eyes even for a second. His body was bruised; and he kept waking up with sudden jolts on even the slightest sound like the vibration on receiving a text. He gasped for breath; and complained that he felt like he was still inside the library; while those goons kept banging at the door. He left for home the next day. His text to us on Whatsapp read: &#x201C;that reading room will always be a nightmare to me.&#x201D;</p><p><br>A state in which libraries are destroyed is bound for calamity. Nothing is more poignant than a state in which the dreams of students are torn to pieces; and are consigned to oblivion. It is very unfortunate that a state which realised its dream of independence through the means of protesting; is itself silencing the peaceful protests and resorting to violence. Nothing is more degrading then that fact that students were ordered to walk in a line with their hands up like criminals. On frisking; those goons would have found books; not bombs. We protest against the rampage to which our university; our home has been subjected. They might break our bones; they might even charge us with sedition; but let us ensure that they do not dare to touch our libraries again. We shall resist.</p>, &#x2013;<strong>Sameem Wani and Adil Manzoor. (BA. HONS. ENGLISH)</strong>, Normal, 17/12/2019

When Delhi Police protected the JMI Campus with Brutality & Force, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/20191216_223138_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>It&#x2019;s 15th of December when thousands of localites took onto the streets to protest against the NRC and CAA in a display of civil resistance. Little did anyone know; about the Delhi Police that was all prepared to test their brute forces and methods on every strand of Jamia Millia Islamia; students; professors and the harmless campus that beared the torture for hours. The politically shy university was turned into a war-zone by the police who apparently turned into genocide warriors.</em></p><p><br>In an educational institution which does not have a Student Union of its own to endorse any political ideologies; the libraries; hostels and places of worship were infiltrated by the Delhi Police on the evening of 15th December. Run by the Ministry of Home Affairs; the Delhi police carries out the orders of the Home Minister. <strong>Waseem Ahmed Khan; Chief Proctor of Jamia Millia Islamia </strong>told Asia News International about how the police broke in without permission and forced the staff and students to flee the spot. Horrifying videos and images have surfaced up amidst the display of <em>gunda raj</em> by the police to suppress dissent against the <strong>NRC</strong> and <strong>CAA</strong>. In the capital city of the nation where students from pan India come to receive education; a truly horrifying spectacle was created with a display of state sanctioned brutality on innocent students; both girls and boys along with staff members. Unarmed women were beaten up; boys were beaten up and humiliated while the police verbally abused them. Police entered the Central Library where students were studying peacefully and began the <em>lathicharge</em>. Videos show the Reading Hall room smoked up from tear gas shells and students being forced to evacuate. Students can be seen ducking under their desks; running without a direction in an attempt to escape the brutality. The current scenario there shows bloodstains on the stairs and walls with chairs; tables; books and bags strewn on the floor.<br><br>A widely circulated video shows a dark room with what seems like a crowd of students trapped inside. The person making the video; a female student; can be heard pleading for help and saying they&#x2019;re in danger as she claims the police broke the glass and threw tear gas shells inside the dark room. Thousands of girls inside Begum Hazrat Mahal and J&amp;K; girls Hostel(s) ; waited with bated breaths as the explosions continued outside. They were asked to stay in their rooms; switch off the lights and push the bed against the door.</p><p><br>&#x201C;We were all downstairs in the reception area where the medical students administered first aid to the injured. We were all scared; we could hear the tear gas shells and the explosions. It was scary; horrifying; to be honest.&#x201D; says a resident of Begum Hazrat Mahal. &#x201C;Suddenly; someone said we have to run. We all ran upstairs. It was truly frightening; we felt we would be left behind. After reaching our rooms; we switched off the lights; put our beds against the door and our phones on silent and waited. Just waited.&#x201D; She further adds.<br><br>It is almost as if the police carried enough ammunition for a heavily armed enemy; when in reality they had to monitor unarmed students of a university that has remained largely apolitical. Could it be because the protesters were viewed as vermin? Did the police receive orders to weed them out or did they act on their own will?<br><br>Delhi police even broke into the Mosque in Gate Number 8 and beat up people offering <em>Isha</em> prayers. The Imam (priest) leading the prayer was beaten up. A video recorded by a student of the university shows the university guard narrating the incidents of brutality; how the police verbally abused him while he stopped them from beating up the Imam. The security guard; an ex Army Jawaan was beaten up by the police. He suffered injuries on his shin and forearm. The explanation given by them goes: <em>since it didn&#x2019;t look like a mosque; they barged inside</em>. But what explains beating up people offering namaaz; the priests and an ex- army personnel other than an inherent bias and a sadistic pleasure from the chaos?<br><br>Earlier in the afternoon; vandalism at its finest was seen with Delhi Police setting fire to a bus before they framed the students for creating mayhem and disturbance in society. <strong>Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi; Manish Sisodia </strong>condemned this act as he told the news channels about this heinous act; said it was they who set the buses ablaze.<br><br>Police reportedly used rubber bullets to fire at protesters. There were also videos of open firing inside the campus. The barbaric behaviour reached its crescendo with police opening fire to disperse the crowd. Guns carried inside an educational institution which houses unarmed students by no one other than the ones supposed to be the protectors.<br><br>The university students reported their phones and WhatsApp groups flooded with pictures of friends who&#x2019;d gone missing during the turbulence. Hundreds of students have been injured; owing to hits and blows on vital organs. Several lie in <em>intensive care units</em>. Several were hoarded like cattle into buses and taken to unknown locations; over hundred students were detained and kept in police stations. Lawyers; advocates and social activists were not allowed to intervene or even enter the police station. All of it happened in the course of a few hours.</p><p>The pandemonium was followed by the BJP IT cell circulating doctored videos of students chanting anti-Hindu slogans and several twitter users changing identities to Muslim names to support the CAA and NRC; all of it while <strong>#jamiaprotest</strong> trended #1 on Twitter.<br><br>The bravado of the students of Jamia did not go unnoticed; Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University students hit the streets and marched to the Police Headquarters to oppose the brutality exhibited by the police. Where international media from The New York Times to All Jazeera adressed the Jamia protests; journalists and public figures like Rana Ayyub; Swara Bhaskar; Rajkumar Rao; John Cussack and Umar Khalid expressed their dissent over the violence.<br><br>Today; just a day later; students of the whole nation stand in solidarity with Jamians as AMU; AASU; TISS; IIT Madras and Bombay; BHU and Presidency College protest against the police crackdown. Jamians continue to protest silently; with perseverance and strength that looks injustice in the eyes and gives it a challenge.</p>, <strong><em>Sania Ansari<br>B.A. (Hons.)

Students of the World Unite, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/20191218_192900_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>15th of December will be registered as a black day in the history of Jamia Millia Islamia when the students of the university were subjected to barbaric atrocities; but it will also be remembered as a day when we witnessed student solidarity throughout the nation as never before; only until we remember the protest disruptions like that of 1974 led by Arun Jaitley; J P Narayan &amp; PM Narendra Modi himself. </em></p><p></p><p>It was 1974 when <strong>Prime Minister Narendra Modi </strong>led the <strong>Navanirmaan Movement</strong> as a <em>young pracharak</em> and associate of ABVP in a much more violent protest ; while J P Narayan led the Sampoorn Kranti Movement in Bihar; in the same year Former Finance Minister  Arun Jaitley organised Sangharsh Samiti for students. </p><p>Mary Mcleod Bethune was very right what she said about our youth in the aforementioned lines. Our youth indeed has the power to move mountains and to bring on new revolutions to change the world for the betterment of the people of the present and of the future. Time and again we have seen the youth of our country to stand and voice their concern over these malpractices of the current Indian Government and have opened the eyes of the people that were earlier blind towards these practices. The youth stood and voiced their concern over the: <strong>2012 Delhi Gang Rape</strong>; <strong>Shutdown of Kashmir</strong>; <strong>2017 Unnao Rape Case </strong>and <strong>2019 Citizenship Amendment Act</strong>. The youth of this country continues to voice their opinions and their views about these heinous acts in India and continues to seek justice for these happenings.</p><p>Jamia Millia Islamia witnessed this light of unity in the most scintillating form on 15<sup>th</sup> of December; 2019 when a peaceful protest outside the varsity campus had turned into a total chaos and a field of mayhem by Delhi Police. </p><p>This monstrous and atrocious action of Delhi Police upon the students; faculty and infrastructures of Jamia didn&#x2019;t go well for the Indian Government as soon the whole world was made obvious to the situation of Jamia Millia Islamia. Photographic evidences of this wicked act were soon spread across the whole world through social media and many news channels also covered this happening to broadcast it to the world. JMI was pushed into darkness as the night unfolded itself and numerous students were taken into detainment and several others were admitted to the hospital in Intensive Care Units. Streets within the Jamia varsity were piled with empty tear gas shells; stones and blood splatters of students that were beaten mercilessly; all in the name of dispersing this peaceful protest that showed dissent against the <strong>Indian Government; Bharatiya Janta Party</strong>.</p><p>The rage of JMI against their dying light of unity was held together by other universities across the state and soon people woke up to the atrocity that JMI had faced and came together to stand with Jamia. Midnight protest was carried out by students of <strong>Jawaharlal Nehru University</strong> and <strong>Delhi University</strong> which asked for the students of Jamia to be released from detainment and actions to be taken against Delhi Police. Soon havoc broke in <strong>Aligarh Muslim University</strong> as well where protests were held for Jamia and internet was shut down by the government amid protest and police officials were given orders to disperse the crowd by any means necessary and so they did.</p><p>Protests for JMI and AMU soon happened all across the country with 49 Indian Universities including <strong>Chandigarh University</strong>; <strong>Banaras Hindu University</strong>; <strong>Nadwa University</strong>; <strong>Darul Uloom Deoband</strong>; <strong>Jadavpur University</strong>; <strong>Indian Institute of Management</strong>; <strong>Tata Institute of Social Sciences</strong>; <strong>Maulana Azad National Urdu University</strong>; <strong>Indian Institute of Science</strong>; <strong>Cochin University of Science and Technology</strong>; <strong>IIT Madras</strong>; <strong>Madras University</strong>; <strong>IIT Bombay</strong>; <strong>IIT Kanpur</strong>; <strong>Loyola College</strong>; <strong>Patna University</strong>; etc. With the <strong>University of Delhi &amp; Jawaharlal Nehru University</strong> leading the protests for students of JMI. </p><p>Solidarity demonstrations have also developed outside the country in as many as 21 universities according to sources; in <strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Cambridge</strong>; <strong>Yale University; Connecticut</strong> and <strong>Harvard University; Cambridge</strong>. Protests have begun in United Kingdom as well to show support for the wicked acts of 15<sup>th</sup> December done against JMI; <strong>Oxford Universit</strong>y stands with Jamia to show their support.</p><p>Many like <strong>Film &amp; Television Institute of India; Pune</strong> have also supported the students; Medical Colleges of Bengal like <strong>R G Kar Medical College</strong>; <strong>Kolkata</strong> which empowered a similar students protest earlier this year &amp; Law Univerities of <strong>NLU Jodhpur; Bangalore; Nagpur; Mumbai; NALSAR Hyderabad; NUSRL Ranchi and IIMs of Ahmedabad; Bangalore </strong>also extended their hand towards students of JMI. </p><p>While esteemed universities and people from all around the world are requesting the Indian Government to reconsider their Citizenship Amendment Act. Marches have been organised all across the country to show sympathy for Jamia and AMU. Open letters have been written to the Indian Government to take proper legal actions against the injustice done to Jamia. The <strong>United Nations</strong> has also criticized India; calling this Act &#x201C;<em>fundamentally discriminatory in nature&#x201D;</em>.</p><p>These protests are manifestations of the student power and the depth of student fraternity that we register all over the world; many say this keeps the hope alive and will continue to resist against the wrong.</p>, <strong><em>YUSUF AZIZ; B.A. (Hons.)

When Trojan intruded Apolitical & Constitutional Protests at JMI & rest of India, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/20191220_023351_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>Jamia Millia Islamia University has always been labeled as a&#xA0;shy university and has maintained this title until couple of months ago when a protest against the administration brought another scope of lens to the university. But; it was the passing of the CAA that led to further penetration into the eye of media as it led to protests. The narrative is multidimensional; subjected with blatant lies. We trace down; how and what are the students still striving for <strong>&#x2018;the week that wasn&#x2019;t&#x2019;</strong>?</em></p><p>The trend of being apolitical is growing in India; politics is corruption; it is a vice; a sin. Facing the other side; having the head in the sand; thinking that if one doesn&#x2019;t know it; it doesn&#x2019;t affect them. People who talk about politics are seen as weird; and &#x201C;<em>Jantar Mantar pe chillanai walai.</em>&#x201D; The one person&#x2019;s words the nation <em>almost </em>unanimously trusts; its Father; he once said; &#x201C;<em>You must be the change you wish to see in the world.</em>&#x201D; We wish a lot and do so little; almost everyone answers the question of what one thing would they wish upon the world as peace. We are dreamers; romantics; and so much more but humans; we hate conflict; stress; defeats; rejection &#x2013; this is what it means to be political. Jamia has <strong>no student union</strong>; <strong>no political stand</strong>; but it took the side of it deemed right when it was needed; it stopped wishing and acted on the wish of all others. And with every action; as we know; follow consequences.</p><p>When we speak our truth with the people around us; we measure; we scale and we route in accordance of reality. Not sharing opinions makes one stuff their truth (which is truth according to them; could be false; could be misinformation) inside and work on it; without care. Jamia spoke its truth in the past week. </p><p>When CAB was passed in Lok Sabha on 10<sup>th</sup> December; which was ironically the Human Rights Day and the birthday of Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar; students held a talk on Citizenship at 1pm at central canteen while CAB was in legislation in the Parliament. Following the next day was the nod of Rajya Sabha and the students of Hall of Boys residence JMI protested at the central canteen to Gate no. 7 to 13; through Girls Hostel and then continued till Gate no. 4. On 12<sup>th</sup> of December the Hall of Girls Residence started a flash march from Ansari Auditorium rejecting NRC and CAA; the protest was led by the female students of JMI. On the 13<sup>th</sup> the <strong>Jamia Teachers Association</strong>; <strong>Jamia Administration and Staff Association</strong>; <strong>SRK Association</strong> and <strong>Jamia School Teachers Association</strong> organised a long march from Jamia to Parliament which was blocked by the police at Gate no. 1. The blockade created a menace; the peaceful protest of the students was infiltrated by a nuisance of locals. The police barricades were being tried and jumped over by protesters and stone pelting was initiated by the locals. Tear gases were even shot all over campus; there is photo evidence of police shooting the tear gas shells inside the campus; were there were no protests going on. The weekend shot up the atrocities of police on the students and locals alike; the policemen even beat up the female students whilst cursing at them. Though Saturday was comparatively silent as the administration released a notice that called for winter vacations from 16 December to 5<sup>th</sup> January. Sunday had the residents of Okhla Vihar calling a protest on the police action that was laid on students and against CAB. Locals joined them; <em>gundas </em>with baseball bats were also witnessed facilitating violence. With this catalyst and the burning of buses (allegedly done by police) spiked the protest and it tuned it to physical aggression and then havoc. </p><p>Later that evening more police joined in with witnesses claiming that members of unlawful organizations were with the police in helmets beating students up. The police authority entered the university premises without permission; entered libraries and beat up students who weren&#x2019;t even a part of the protests. Dozens of students were brutally beaten up; tear gas was shot inside the libraries and hostels; all through this; verbal assault and inhumane attitude towards the students was prevalent. &#x201C;<em>Sari blindness tumhari aaj hei nikaltai hai</em>&#x201D; were the exact words of the policemen while they beat up a blind student inside the library. There are videos of police open firing at protesters; mercilessly beating them up. The detained students were being <strong>denied medical care</strong> inside Kalkaji Station and a colossal damage was laid to university property. It was a sport of power projection for them. Even the mosque was destroyed and the Imam was beaten up; the guards of the university account for the violence of the police. One video surfaced in which even the guards were physically and verbally assaulted.</p><p>After all the violence; on Monday the university witnessed a <strong>silent protest</strong>; where the traffic got easy passage &amp; ambulances faced no hindrances. At the Ghalib Statue of Gate no. 7 the students were singing the National Anthem and there was conducted a reading of the Preamble and the tricolour was hailed all around. The protests still on; silent; shaken but determined; the trojan got in because the students had trust in the authority; it was exploited; it was used to feed an ideology. Jamia spoke up and trojan has made them realise that it&#x2019;s time to speak up; the time that they&#x2019;ll embark either as victims or as perpetrators in someone&#x2019;s eye; neither of which will stop them from sailing. </p><p>On Tuesday; saw more people joining the MMAJ Marg with Tricolor all over the place; Lawyers; Bureaucrats &amp; many other organizations supported the protesters that included students &amp; general public. Bollywood Actor; Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub also joined the dissent demonstrations. </p><p>This Wednesday we witnessed Social Activist Medha Patkar at the Protest site; following which student leader Kanhaiya Kumar also joined the protesters against the police actions &amp; unconstitutional bill. </p><p>The protests have found a pan India presence with leading personalities; academic intellectual &amp; eminent institutions of the country expressing the resentment against the government and it&#x2019;s actions. </p><p>This is surely one of the darkest hours of Indian Democracy with the most visible voicing ever since 70s.</p>, <strong>Raafat Gilani</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) English; Jamia Millia Islamia</strong>, Normal, 19/12/2019 
The Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019: A deliberate Assault on Constitutionalism and Secularism, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/20191213_094402_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>The Citizenship Amendment Bill; an instrument that allows the leaders to acclaim a position to question a person&#x2019;s citizenship and it&#x2019;s targeting of a certain community; namely the Muslim community who is the primary target of the NRC exercise that can be deemed as unconstitutional; unethical and manifestly arbitrary.</em></p><p><br><strong>The Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 (CAB)</strong> is brazenly discriminatory and it is only a matter of time before its constitutionality is subjected to severe judicial scrutiny. In both its content and working; the proposed amendment singles out a community for hostile treatment. The act aims to ensure that Hindu; Sikhs; Buddhist; Jains; Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan; Pakistan and Bangladesh are no longer considered as illegal immigrants even if they enter the Indian premises without a valid visa/document before 2014 and fast track their citizenship for the same. This is done in accordance with the amendment of the Citizenship Act of 1995.<br>In 2016; a similar attempt was made by the BJP led NDA government; when it met with a opposition in the Rajya Sabha due to significant opposition in North East but on the 10th of December this year; the act was passed in the Lok Sabha with a vote favour of 311-80 and the following day in Rajya Sabha with a margin of 125-105. While; the Indian Muslim League has challenged the constitutionality of this Act; the suo moto interference of The Supreme Court of India seems like the only available option. If this act is not struck down by the Supreme Court; it will further dilute the secularism policy of the Constitution of India.<br>During the Rajya Sabha proceedings; AAP MP Sanjay Singh said that the bill is against the constitution made by Bhima Rao Ambedkar; preamble of the Constitution and the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhagat Singh.</p><p><br><strong>What is the Constitutionality of the CAB???</strong><br>The CAB is liable to be struck down by the Supreme Court as it is in direct violation of the Article 14 of the Indian Constitution which says that the state shall not deny any person equality before the law and the equal protection of the law within the territory of India.<br>Although there are more grounds but the Article 14 will be substantial enough to strike down the act; it is also in violation of the Article 15 (prohibition of discrimination); Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) and Article 25 (right to practice one&#x2019;s religion).<br>There are two broadways to argue that a law violates Article 14. Firstly; the law provides for differential treatment of a class of person but this classification is not reasonable. Secondly; the law is manifestly arbitrary.<br>While introducing and defending the Act; Home Minister Amit Shah; used the term reasonable classification several times to defend the content of the CAB. However; as per the law their reception of the reasonable classification is entirely flawed.<br><strong><em>&#x201C;A reasonable classification is when the object of the classification bears and access to the classification itself. Here we are looking at refugees on religious ground. If that is the object of the bill; then the all refugees who are fleeing religious persecution; irrespective of their religion or lack of religion should be allowed in.&#x201D;</em></strong><br>It is evident that the act is arbitrary on the ground that it considers Afghanistan; Bangladesh and Pakistan as neighboring countries but simultaneously fails to consider Tibet; Sri Lanka and Myanmar as same.<br><strong><em>&#x201C;Arbitrariness of a nature which is an outrageous defiance of logic will also come under judicial scrutiny&#x2026; the Indian Constitution is religion blind.It provides equal weight for all religions.&#x201D;</em></strong></p><p><br><strong>CAB as Anti-Muslim?</strong><br>It is clear that the whole exercise of CAB is based on religious excuse and is flimsy with the probable inability to stand thereof when the matter goes up to the Supreme Court. It is explicitly clear that the CAB is demonstrably anti-Muslim; it is not even in hold when it is viewed in conjunction with the proposed National Register of Citizens or its implementation with regard to the entire nation.<br>India is a Secular country; our citizenship was never based on religious grounds but a collective commitment to equality liberty and justice to all. But; such religious persecutions seem to dwindle this significant aspect of our Constitution and move us away from the idea of Constitutional India.</p><p><br><strong>What is the change?</strong><br>Refugees running from religious persecution without documents from Pakistan; Bangladesh and Afghanistan will be granted Indian citizenship within 6 years of their living in India instead of the early bar of 12 years. The law is only applicable to those refugees who are Hindu; Sikh; Buddhist and Christians.</p><p><br>Hence; it can be said that this Act is targeting a community without naming it and the theory of two nation; which was propagated by Savarkar will be duly fulfilled through this Act.</p>, <strong><em>MOHD ALTAMASH; B.

However; the struggles endured by the social reformers of antiquity made these rights possible. Jyotiba Govindrao Phule along with his wife Savitri Bai Phule was one such social reformer of the 19th century who pioneered women education and worked for the welfare of the depressed classes. Mahatma Phule denounced the caste system and the injustices it perpetrated and made relentless efforts to eradicate the social evils that plagued our society. He scorned the rules of purity and pollution; which divided the society into a hierarchy that was both unjust and inhuman. In Pune; he set up the first school in the country for girls with his wife who became the headmistress of the school and devoted her life to educating women and Shudras. She also went on to establish a night school for agriculturists and labourers. In 1873; he founded the Satyashodhak Samaj or the Truth Seeker&#x2019;s Society; which fought for the rights of depressed classes; inspiring other people to join it and work for the uplifment of the depressed classes. He contributed greatly towards the abolition  of untouchability emancipation of women.</p><p><br>Eminent speakers from different universities and scholarly backgrounds underlined the contribution made by Mahatma Jyotiba Phule.</p><p><br>Mahatma Jyotiba Phule was a harbinger of change who dreamt of an ideal society where all members of the society were equal regardless of their caste; race and sex. The event underlined Phule&#x2019;s teachings and contribution to a equal society and its relevance in contemporary society.</p>, <br><strong><em>MARYAM AHMED </em></strong>                                                                                                                                                            <strong><em>B.A. (HONS.)

The Irishman: An Adieu by Scorsese?, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/20191130_101441_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>Just when the world thought they had had enough of the &#x2018;Italian-Mob&#x2019; based movies and shows; Martin Scorsese; The King of Crime genre; delivers us with the much awaited Netflix&#x2019;s The Irishman. The Irishman delivers us another one of Scorsese&#x2019;s masterpieces with our beloved actors like Joe Pesci; Al Pacino; Robert De Niro; etc. but with a tint of old-age on themselves.</em></p><p>The Irishman; directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese; is based on the book I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank &#x201C;The Irishman&#x201D; Sheeran &amp; Closing the Case on Jimmy Hoffa by Charles Brandt. The screenplay is written by Academy Award&#xAE; winner Steven Zaillian and stars many Academy Award&#xAE; winners like Robert De Niro; Al Pacino; Joe Pesci &amp; Anna Paquin. The story begins in the 1950s; when a truck driver by the name of Frank Sheeran gets involved with a &#x201C;made&#x201D; man by the name of Russell Bufalino and his Pennsylvania Crime Family. The plot thickens as Sheeran; aka The Irishman; is shown to climb the ranks to become a top hitman and also goes to work for the well known Jimmy Hoffa who is a powerful Teamster with ties to the organized crime. The plot continues on to show the developments in the life of Frank Sheeran and the inevitable end he has to deal with when his life finally comes to an end.<br>The first few frames of the movie begin with an aged Robert De Niro (Frank Sheeran) sitting in a wheelchair at a Catholic convalescent home. The story is narrated by Sheeran to us as he flashes-back on his life which began as a truck driver delivering steaks and then blowing up cars and warehouses and then finally blowing up people for the &#x201C;made&#x201D; men and for his bosses. Although the movie might seem like any other of Scorsese&#x2019;s mindless murders and crime related movies but The Irishman is actually not that at all. The Irishman is a tale of men who see murder as inevitable but eventually see it as a sign of failure and seek for grace within the arms of God.<br>As much as the world was looking forward to Robert De Niro and Al Pacino on the big screen; Joe Pesci&#x2019;s return to the big screen was more to look forward to. Joe Pesci; who had retired from acting in 1999 with occasional cameos here-and-there but in Scorsese&#x2019;s The Irishman; Pesci returns in somewhat a leading role and delivers a performance that will be remembered for more than a decade or two. His aging look didn&#x2019;t stop him from being himself and giving us a performance; he once gave us in Goodfellas. From the hard-shelled gangster (in the beginning of the movie) to the shivering-shell of a man (towards the end of the movie); he stays top notch in his acting and forces us to praise all the Gods existing for his return from the retirement.</p><p>The Irishman seems like a goodbye by Martin Scorsese to this specific genre of movies. The characters undergoing a looming fear of mortality; a sense of self-righteousness about crime and the crushing guilt over the fallout on friends and family are the characteristics of a well-defined classic gangster movie. The Irishman accommodates all this but with a force of intensity so hard that you can not help but think that this might be a final goodbye by Martin Scorsese as he delivers us one last masterpiece from the bottom of his heart with a cast full of actors we have grown up to love and admire.</p>, <strong><em>YUSUF AZIZ;                                                                           B.A.(HONS.)

Caste System: A Blot on Human Rights, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/img-20191210-wa0016.jpg?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>In times when basic rights violations are at it&#x2019;s peak with examples like the Citizenship Amendment Bill in India &amp; Xinjiang Reeducation Camps in China; caste Discrimination takes a jab in it&#x2019;s most nascent form this International Human Rights Day. </em></p><p>International Human Rights Day is observed globally on the 10th of December every year. This date was chosen to fete The United Nations General Assembly&#x2019;s proclamation on the 10th of December; 1948. It was the first body which worked towards the recognition of Human Rights as a vital means of basic survival; the enunciation of human rights was probably a humongous take at developing a subtle form of life by The United Nations.</p><p>&#x201C;The rights of every man are diminished if the rights of one man is threatened.&#x201D;</p><p><br>Living in a society; where we encounter people from various spheres; trying to cope with their lives; trying to make ends meet with utmost efforts and diminutive resources; we are bound to reflect the fact that Human Rights are still not a piece of cake for every living individual. The deprivation of Human Rights is a factor which is very evident in our very own country. A country; known for its diversity; regionalism and secularism; shows this bereavement wearing a mask and being prevalent in every nook and corner. The filthiest form of human rights abation is the baby of the infamous caste system of the country.</p><p><br>The caste system in India is the most pristine form of Human Rights violation which has been widely accepted and recognized by the people of the country since the very beginning. According to it; the people of a particular society were divided into various groups; one being on top of the other; and the lowest of them would be at the sake of the ones above them. The system is so rigorous that the sect which lies at the bottom of this establishment are considered untouchables and are not even regarded as human beings.They are not allowed to sit with the upper caste people and not allowed to visit or enter religious places. They are expected to lower their gazes while talking to someone from the upperhand community. Their daily earnings come from jobs which a civilized human cannot think of performing. They are forced to live an inhumane life; a life they don&#x2019;t ask for.</p><p><br>Recently a movie named Article 15; starring the prominent actor Ayushman Khurrana depicted the struggles of people belonging to the lower faction. The movie was a clear representation of the negligence and the hypocrisy showed by the government as well as by the civilians when it comes to the maladies suffered by these people.The prevailing caste system has been so ramrod that it has devoid human beings of their rights to justice; to freedom; to speech and even to live with dignity. It&#x2019;s persistence is an engraving on a tombstone. Something that is very difficult to get rid of.</p><p><br>It is a blot on the society and the Society wears it with pride.<br>&#x201C;Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean;<br>man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives.<br>Man&#x2019;s life is independent.<br>He is born not for the development of the society alone; but for the development of his self too.&#x201D;<br>-Dr. B.R Ambedkar</p>, <strong><em>Hadiqua Jabeen<br>B.Sc.(Hons.)

While all other departments of the varsity are busy conducting their semester exams; Faculty of Law got its feet wet by adjourning the end-semester exams out of the blue and unlike any other department; by proffering the defaulters with a diamond opportunity to expiate for their short attendance by coming to class regularly from 5th December to 15th December.<br>Faculty of Law paved the way for all the other departments of Jamia Milia Islamia to forsake their arbitrary discretion when it comes to harsh attendance policy &amp; to follow a legit procedure pepper with clemency.</p><p><br>I am not suffering from Stockholm Syndrome but I cannot resist myself from panegyrizing the management of the Faculty of Law for its exceptional showcase of benignity.<br>The decision of rescheduling the exams is acquiescent; quite a rare phenomenon in the Faculty of Law as tacitly; students here are always set to instigate establishment related upheavals but this resolution came across no major dissent because it benefitted not only the absentees but also the regular students as now they are getting additional time to go through the syllabus once again which in turn will help them in scoring better grades.<br>&#x201C;The administration has taken a prodigious step with the sole intent of helping the students with insufficient attendance and it is beneficial for us also as now; we can go for revision of the syllabus in depth.&#x201D;<br>As quoted by Fras Abbas; student of Faculty of Law; JMI.<br>The postponement of the semester exams might appear to be akin to neurosis to some students &amp; they may give vitriolic statements about the same but by and large; it is nothing less than a succour to the damoiseau in distress.</p>, <strong><em>Sadaf Parvez Rajput; BA LLB (Hons.); Jamia Millia Islamia</em></strong>, Normal, 05/12/2019 
Sadhvi Pragya: Controversies from Sangh to Sabha, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/img-20191204-wa0023.jpg?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>BJP MP and Terror Acussed Sadhvi Pragya has stirred another controversial remark by referring Gandhi&#x2019;s assasinator Nathuram Godse as a patriot. But; this isn&#x2019;t the first time that the newly electedMP has made such polemic; with a long history of controversies to her name let&#x2019;s trace her history of remarks and that of herself. </em></p><p>&#x201C;Evil does not arrive from outside our civilization; from a separate realm we are tempted to call &#x2018;primitive; evil is generated by the civilization itself;&#x201D; writes Michael Mann in his 2004 book The Dark Side of Democracy.<br>This is not the first time that the Bhopal MP has found her amidst a controversy in her seven months political career.<br>This game of controversies began in mid-April 2019 when Pragya Singh Thakur official joined the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP). The very next day she was fielded as the party&#x2019;s candidate from Bhopal against Congress&#x2019;s Digvijaya Singh. This unique recruitment by the BJP saw a great number of backlashes coming from the Indian political circle. Unique; because it was for the first in Independent India that a political party had fielded a terror accused as a candidate for the Parliamentary Elections. She defeated Digvijaya Singh with a margin of 364;822 votes and won her debut election.<br><strong>What is her History?</strong><br>Born to Chandrapal Singh; a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker; in the Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh; Pragya Singh has a long association with the Sangh Parivar (an umbrella term; to the collection of Hindu nationalist organisations). She has done her post graduation in history. Durning her student days she was an active member of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP); the student wing of the RSS. She has also worked in the Durga Vahini; women&#x2019;s wing of the Bajrang Dal.<br>She is one of the prime accused in the 2008 Malegaon blasts which killed nearly 10 people. She was arrested in 2009 for the same. Pragya Singh was given a clean chit by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in 2015. Special public prosecutor; Rohini Salian had told The Indian Express that the NIA was putting pressure on her to go slow on the case. Though she was given a clean chit by the NIA; the trial court refused to discharge her from the case.</p><p><br><strong>The Sequence of Controversies!</strong><br>Pragya Thakur is not new to controversies. The Hindu ascetic&#x2019;s provocative speeches and statements have often made major headlines. She has often referred Nathuram Godse as a patriot.<br>It was the first time during the run up for the General Elections; when she referred to Godse as a deshbhakt. A disciplinary committee was formed by the then BJP President Amit Shah to probe into the matter; but no adequate action was taken against her. BJP just issued a showcause notice to her and the matter was brought to a standstill. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said he would never be able to forgive her for the remarks. During an interview to the News 24 in May he said;<br>&#x201C;Whatever has been said about Gandhiji or Godse; whatever statements have been made in this regard; are extremely bad; in every way worthy of contempt and criticism. Such language and thinking isn&#x2019;t part of any civilised society; and it can&#x2019;t be allowed. Therefore; those who are doing this have to pause a hundred times. Though she has apologised; I won&#x2019;t be able to forgive her in my mind&#x201D;<br>During her campaigning she also made a controversial statement about the Late Maharashtra ATS Chief Hemant Karkare who was killed in 26/11 Mumbai attacks. &#x201C;Hemant Karkare falsely implicated me and treated me very badly. I told him your entire dynasty will be erased. He died of his karma;&#x201D; she reportedly said.</p><p><br><strong>What did the BJP do?</strong><br>For all her controversial statements the BJP has distanced itself and asked her to tender a public apology. However; no official action was taken against her by the party. Avinash Rai Khanna &#x2013; the BJP&#x2019;s disciplinary committee chair had earlier told The Wire that; his committee had submitted its report and recommendations to the party president but it was up to him to decide what has to be done. &#x201C;We had submitted the report a while ago but received no word since;&#x201D; he said. This clearly shows that PM Modi&#x2019;s claim of never being able to forgive Thakur was just another jumla and it had no meaning behind it.<br>The biggest irony was when earlier this month the terror accused BJP MP was nominated to a parliamentary committee on defence. The BJP removed her from this committee after her controversial statement on Godse in the Lok Sabha. But the question remains; that why was a terror accused even nominated to a committee which is to look after the nation&#x2019;s security? Pragya Thakur has not once; but several times referred to the assassin Godse as a deshbhakt. Isn&#x2019;t this an out-of-line insult to the Father of our Nation; Mahatma Gandhi?<br>2019 is the year when the whole world; including India is celebrating Gandhiji&#x2019;s 150th Birth Anniversary. It is a matter of utter shame that we have an elected MP who praises Gandhiji&#x2019;s assassin on regular occasions; and that too in the parliament itself.<br>In my opinion; Pragya Thakur&#x2019;s apologies have no meaning behind them. They are just made to bridge over the embarrassment which the Bharatiya Janta Party has to suffer. She is actually not at sorry; but is indeed proud in calling Godse a deshbhakt. She is a proud member of the political mindset of the Sangh Parivar; which even Godse was a part of.</p>, <strong><em>Sahil Kazmi; BBA; Jamia Millia Islamia</em></strong>, Normal, 04/12/2019 
Bala- The Bald with Balls?, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/20191129_084908_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>&#x2018;Presenting a subject so craftfully; the filmmakers have balanced the struggles of a bald man with hard hitting comic situations that Bala&#x2019;s predicament creates. The strong cast has done quite a commendable job.</em>&#x2018;<br>Bala; is a 2019 movie directed by Amar Kaushik; and stars Ayushmann Khurrana; Bhumi Pednekar; Yami Gautam in lead roles. The plot revolves around the story of a man (Bala) who struggles with premature balding. The story follows his love story with Pari (Yami Gautam) who is a tik tok star; and his conflict with his childhood classmate Latika (Bhumi Pednekar.) Bala torn by the insecurity of his physical appearance tries several methods to regain his falling hair. His failed attempts include applying all sorts of oils; eggs and even bull&#x2019;s semen. After several failed attempts he resorts to wearing a wig. He meets Pari with the wig on and they fall in love; with Pari in absolute dark about the fake hair. Bala&#x2019;s adventures trying to keep his secret promises a hilarious; joyful ride.</p><p><br>The director has presented the subject beautifully; balancing the struggles of a bald man with comic situations that Bala&#x2019;s predicament creates. The strong cast has done quite a commendable job. Ayushmann Khurrana is amazing as Bala; portraying the emotions of struggle and insecurity with pure finesse; his comic timing is also impeccable. Bhumi Pednekar is fierce in the role of a lawyer. She plays the role of a dark complexioned girls who fights against the odds of the society that aims to downgrade her for her compexion. Yami Gautam plays the character of the girl who is an internet sensation. She delivers the extreme emotions felt by her over dramatic character perfectly. While some may call it overacting; but I will call it demand of the character which she delivers stunningly. My favourite is the scene where she finds out that Bala is actually bald. Her over dramatic tone makes the emotionally tense moment hilarious. Her running as she shouts &#x2018;Mera Pati Takla hai&#x2019;; was one of the most tickling scenes.<br>The script writer has quite brilliantly made the movie relevant to the current times; by including TikTok in the love story. There are no unnecessary Item songs; romantic songs inserted forcibly in between. The flow of the movie is quite natural; with no boring moments. The movie will not let your attention flatter.</p><p><br>Bala is a story about flawed people; dealing with their physical imperfections; a story about their realization of real meaning of beauty. While Bala has a strong cause behind it; it falls for the same hypocrisy that it aims to fight. Casting Bhumi Pednekar as the dark skinned girl is inappropriate on so many levels. If the skin colour of the lead actresses was so important to the story; why not cast a girl with the same colour? Here also the dark skinned girls have been side lined; denied the opportunity of a role that could have been fit for them.<br>Bala may be a unique concept but it delivers a flawed message. The movie ends with Bala realizing that he should not change his appearances rather get comfortable with how he looks.<br>The movie reinforces the culture of people making fun of each other in the end. Bala asks his audience to not get affected by the jokes made on their expense; which is quite ignorant. Urging the person to change from within rather than asking the society to rise from the shackles of regressive thinking is where Bala fails.. He also pleads the audience to not change and get comfortable in their skin which was good advice.<br>Bala end with the dialogue Badalna Kyu hai; has my heart.<br>Bala is a fun ride which deserves your time. A movie that balances social message with comedy is worth watching. In the age of remakes and sequels we need fresh movies like Bala.<br>I will give it a 4/ 5 stars.</p>, <br><strong><em>Rutba Iqbal<br>B.A. (Hons.)

Feminism & Masculinity: Ideas vs. Ideologies, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/20191119_215924_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>We are standing on the shoulders of giants when it comes to fight for gender equality but by using gender specific language; we bury the lead which in turn halts us in shining the spotlight on the issues that really matters. In order to demand equal rights for women; both men &amp; women must be part of cohesive whole as our society is crying for a new paradigm anchored around more gender neutral language &amp; less binary divisions &amp; can thus forge an overarching equality instead of expositing cavils.</em> </p><p><br> By aforementioned phrase &#x2018;gender specific language&#x2019;; I want to specifically talk about the usage of term &#x2018;feminist&#x2019;. &#x2018;Feminist&#x2019; seems to have first been used in 19th century in a french medical text to describe a cessation in development of the sexual organs and characteristics in male patients; who were perceived as thus suffering from &#x2018;feminization&#x2019; of their bodies. The term then used by Alexander dumas; a republican (so obviously; an anti feminist) on the subject of adultery; to describe women behaving in a supposedly masculine way. Actually; Mary Wollstonecraft; Olympe de gouges and Theroigne de mericourt talked about women&#x2019;s rights even before the term was coined. </p><p><br>Feminism is thus a term that emerged long after women started questioning their inferior status &amp; demanding an amelioration in their social position. So; I don&#x2019;t think the word &#x2018;feminism&#x2019; is as essential as minimum three cups of chai a day for me. <br> In my view point; we are in dire need to inculcate a more inclusive word; we should use a word like &#x2018;equalism&#x2019; to fight for our rights as a word &#x2018;feminism&#x2019; is more likely to create a binary division. We should use a more gender neutral language &amp; stop putting qualifiers on everything such as on clothes; colours; jobs etc. We need to understand that masculinity &amp; feminity are formed by socio-cultural expectations and not by biological differences. It is important to feel included &amp; the word &#x2018;feminism&#x2019; is not at all unifying but polarizing as it focuses more on differences. <br> Formerly; I also used to be a staunch feminist &amp; what made me so was my unshakable faith in Islam. At the age of 16; I read extensively about Islam (it&#x2019;s history; prevalent practices &amp; all other supplements to Quran)  &amp; what i found was &#x2018;it is making a business out of selling patriarchal norms&#x2019;. I tried extremely hard to unfold all the chaos &amp; wrap my mind in comfortable conventions of the society but the rigid Shariah laws failed me to lift up. Accepting such misogynistic practices as the rules made by god was a bitter pill for me to swallow. It was harder than any other emotional riot my mind was fighting at that moment. The pain was so sharp that it teared me apart. It was the time when &#x201C;feminism&#x201D; came into my life like fresh air. I started believing that there would be a rainbow after storm of change &amp; I took the onus of bringing that change; at least in my life if not in an entire world.<br> After reading a lot in this direction; I found that the misogynistic practices emerged in Islam are not only because of the flawed reading of Islam but also from a flawed epistemology of reading. Deification of women and the difference between the ideal and real women also led to their textual harassment. The meaning scholars ascribe to a text arises from the act of reading which is itself gendered or masculinized. If I say that; &#x201C;Different readings of the same text can yield fundamentally different Islam&#x201D;; it would appear as if I am shifting my loyalties from feminism to postmodern feminism but i am just trying to be more equal. Postmodern feminism I believe is the superlative form of liberalism. It bluntly rejects the notion of foundational truth or essence as truth is always partial; constructed &amp; contingent. This means that there can no longer be any attempt to describe; analyse or explain reality in an objective or scientific way. It bluntly rejects feminism as it is conventional  in nature &amp; claims to know the truth which are not neutral but gender specific reflections of power. For instance; think about the &#x2018;scientific&#x2019; claim common in 19th century Britain that the formal education &amp; over development of the intellect would damage a woman&#x2019;s reproductive capacities. Ironical?<br> It lays emphasis on the importance of &#x2018;speakability&#x2019;. Not only in terms of what can be spoken but also; who can speak it. It is not just what is allowed to be said but also by whom it is allowed to be said. Why can&#x2019;t I; for instance; ever say to my parents that I will do an interfaith marriage (in order to break the norms) without adding a qualifier &#x2018;may be&#x2019;? It is all about dispersed nature of power.<br> This acceptance &amp; fluidity is not the same for men and they are still widely expected to live within their conventional stereotypes such as they should not express their emotions publically; they should be ferocious &amp; it is mandatory for men to maintain a socially dominant position over other gender identities &amp; if they fail to do so; they can be thrusted out of this synthetically created fabrication of manhood. The expectations attached to differential roles of men &amp; women serve as the foundation of gender inequality in society &amp; trust me; these gender specific roles are way more threatening to men than to women. We are not gender conforming robots; we are complex human beings with countless traits that should not be confined by a gender. None of us can live on one side or the other. My identity should not be decided by my etiquettes; being assertive or my hatred for high heels &amp; make-up. <br>Being a law student; it is obvious for me to substantiate my point with a legal example. For how long will we shun men&#x2019;s rights &amp; continue making one-sided gender centric laws? Let&#x2019;s talk about Section 498a of Indian Penal Code; it is to prevent violence &amp; cruelty perpetrated on married woman by her husband &amp; his family but 35 years down the line; today 498a of IPC is known as the most abused law in the history of Indian jurisprudence. Hundreds of thousands of people have committed suicide fighting false dowry &amp; domestic violence cases. Molestation &amp; Rape cases are similar extensions to this fact; where many a times sour relations are shaped as sexual abuse. <br> So; we as a responsible citizenry should overcome this pull of conformity; I know it&#x2019;s hard but when the stakes are high &amp; the majority is wrong; the courage of one person can make all the difference. When you see injustice happening in the name of justice to women; refuse to remain neutral &amp; go on off the beaten path &amp; start fighting for equality.</p>, <strong><em>SADAF RAJPUT; B.A. (LLB); JAMIA MILLIA ISLAMIA</em></strong>, Normal, 19/11/2019 
The Agents of Pessimism in the State of Control, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/20191117_141642_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>The wave of intolerance that has taken over the country is a definitive product of the fake news culture. This way of thinking is further pushed forward by the representatives and informers of the public that we in layman&#x2019;s terms call the journalists. This indeed has led to the decrease of the potentials of positive journalism and its effects on the masses.</em></p><p>I have a confession to make to my readers; it is that I have a rather pessimistic approach to life. I look at the glass as half empty with just a few gulps of water left. In fact the seasons depress me. They are a constant reminder of how things end after robbing you of either the warmth of the sun; the sweet cold of winter or the crippling leaves. This pessimism of mine doesn&#x2019;t only come from the fact that half my genes are highly and actively negative but it also is boosted by my place of birth and I give credit where credit is due.  <br>There is a way pessimism is spread. It is more like a spirit that you pour all over and then light a small matchstick to put everything to fire. If you ask us; the agents of pessimism; we&#x2019;ll tell you that we have embedded ourselves in this society just like the spirit gets soaked up in objects and all we ever need to flame up is a tiny little spark. Thanks to our country and its secret allegiance to this school of thought; it has provided many matchsticks to help spread the order; further into the nooks and corners of the society where people still have the ability to raise the flags of peace and happiness. The biggest agents that we have amongst us are not the ministers who go up on the podium to spread the word of selective positivity; no. but in actuality are the fierce; bold and loud men and women you see on your television screens every evening after a tiring day of work. Their coarse voice plays a soothing tune in your head; while their pointy gestures virtually massage the tense tendons of your body and slowly when you fall asleep on your couch; their speeches about hate and regress crawls up in your subconscious mind and takes over the whole system.  These are the top tier journalists; the want to be top tiers and the straight up copy cats. The biggest factor to pushing people towards pessimism is concealing the truth from them and this job that is being well done by the journalists of our country; actually if you think about it; this is the only job they are doing. </p><p><br>Our society/state has created a profession that not only spreads negativity but aims to tackle the leftover effects of positivity by covering up any marks of it. These agents get to play an off putting story; create fraudulent news or sensationalize feelings of hate and remorse to keep people from seeing the truth. Now my dear readers; when we are talking about the truth here we refer to the propaganda that is being spread through the passage of pessimism. In this country; journalism which was supposed to be a remarkable profession of truth and virtue has resorted to the fundaments of <strong>&#x201C;Safforinised Yellow journalism&#x201D;</strong>. Every news  channel aims to woo the viewers who have already fallen through the rabbit hole of negativity. Instead of helping them take their blind folds off; these journalists further darken their visions by creating a series of news that diverts the viewers attention from real issues for example <em>even after over 100 days of communication blackout in Kashmir; no news media did any form of coverage for this crucial piece; instead chose to air the false stories of &#x201C;normalcy returning to the streets of the valley&#x201D;</em>. In fact some of the rebellious journalists; who wanted to represent the realities of the state; were barred from even visiting the place. This proves the importance of censorship in spreading this idea; where people believe that bad things must have the upper hand; and good is more than often neglected. </p><p><br>Journalists have a huge influence; when it comes to selling an idea to the people of a country. These are the representatives of the reality. So when the reality is altered in such a manner that it only benefits a singular part of a diverse society; the whole scheme becomes toxic. If we switch our televisions on right now; we&#x2019;ll most definitely find at least three journalists trying to sell propaganda and cheating the news by presenting an irrelevant story about things that hardly matter. The cotemporary journalists have become so self-centered that they wish to create an image of themselves that fits in with the popular nationalist-hardcore-puppet of the government criteria. People are afraid of going against the pessimistic approach of the country. Where journalists; who were rather great orators like <strong>Arnab Goswami </strong>or impeccable presenters like <strong>Sweta Singh</strong>; have given themselves over wholly to the state; could&#x2019;ve helped in pulling the majority out of the pits of pessimism.  But unfortunately like all things; they too went to waste. Due to this phenomenon of selling what will sell the best instead what would be a better thing to do; the journalism of India has lost its legitimacy. It has become an entertainment industry that runs on the orders of a state. A democracy that should separate the media from the state has therefore transformed itself into a government that merged both of the things so roughly; that neither of the institutions can be trusted anymore. It became the biggest factor in creating a negative air that surrounds our country now and my dear sorry readers; I feel that all of us slowly are breathing the same thing that intoxicates our knowledge; approach and ideas.                                                                     Oh all I can say is that I hope that God saves us all but first detaches the whip of control from the skin of the journalists where they&#x2019;ll be free and help us free ourselves from the quicksand of pessimism that is devouring our country.</p>, <br><strong><em>BABRA SHAFIQI &#x2013; B.A (hons ) ENGLISH; JAMIA MILLIA ISLAMIA</em></strong>, Normal, 17/11/2019 
Elitist Exploitation of the Proletarian Pack : How to avoid being sheep in that regard, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/20191116_122341_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em><strong>Even in the 21st century; we choose blissful ignorance over identifying ways in which the government fleeced our ancestors; and still continues to do so. We ignore the recurring signs that tell us that we&#x2019;re all still stuck with the herd mentality. Because we presuppose that government works for our welfare;  forgetting that it is but a group of INDIVIDUALS. </strong></em></p><p>A common saying goes; &#x201C;four types of people loot the people and exploit the society- the rich; the powerful; the intelligent and the priests.&#x201D;</p><p>A few decades earlier; that would&#x2019;ve sounded like something off a sketchy conspiracy theory site; something totally delusional like a clickbait link. However; we have to keep in mind the concept of conspiracy theory as it was understood first in the 1960s- a far out theory that seems like a product of irrational thinking. First mentioned in connection with the Kennedy assassination; there wasn&#x2019;t much research done to prove that the conspiracy theorists were right; and the theories did not gain popular currency; until recent times. </p><p>Over half a century after USA&#x2019;s project Sunshine was confered in the wake of Hiroshima; the United States Government confirmed a theory that was branded outlandish at that time. In order to test the effect of Strontium 90 in human bone tissue; the US Department of energy and the UK Atomic Energy Authority used stillborn infants shipped from as far as Australia. Its highly likely that the parents of the newly deceased infants weren&#x2019;t even informed about the project before the bodies were used as samples; and all of this wasn&#x2019;t declassified until the Clinton administration. </p><p>Now this raises questions about the authenticity of various other &#x2018;conspiracy theories&#x2019; that states how the government and high profile people control the minds; ideologies and lives of other people. This would also explain why they go to extreme lengths to discredit these theories and prove that they are not true in the first place; even when strong evidence(s) support the claims against them.</p><p>It goes without saying that the dominant class in any society uses the working class as an instrument to protect their vested interests. In the views of <strong>Hungarian Marxist George Lukacs</strong>; &#x201C;the bourgeois ideology seeks to dominate; influence and contaminate the psychological consciousness of the proletariat&#x201D;. The same goes for people of the nation. In these times of sycophancy; bigotry and communal polarization; we as Indians are kept distracted by the use of faith to turn us against each other. A citizen who&#x2019;s well aware of his/her socioeconomic; financial and political rights is one of the worst nightmares of the interest oriented elite. And so majority of youth; the nation of tomorrow; comes from an education system where rote learning and conformity to the norm is rewarded and any attempt to put forward an alternative point of view is stifled. The Indian education system as it exists is a legacy of the British; meant to create efficient office clerks that dispatch mind numbing repetitive tasks with ease and efficiency. We are not encouraged to think and critically analyse and no wonder Indians lag behind in research fields in spite of being academically brilliant and the ignorance has seeped so deep into the societal DNA. </p><p>Unarguably; there&#x2019;s rising levels of intolerance in the country specifically where the rich; the powerful and the priests are looting the resources while the intelligent stay quiet in the face of polarization and dehumanization of the common man.<br> Liberty means responsibility; that is why most men dread it. <br>People that hold the ideals of humanity and the resoluteness of facts make up a very small minority; most of us have turned into background white noise; and have become the embodiment of the very thing wrong with free speech. We ignore the very signs of history repeating itself. There might come a day when we finally realise that the higher class controlling us wasnt a hollow conspiracy theory; but a reality. But it might be too late. </p><p>Now the question arises; what exactly do we do to not fall into the dismal abyss of ignorance. The answer is simple- speak up. Initiate conversations; rationalize; try to identify the writings on the wall. Identify the bigotry in your own family and social circle. Question what they&#x2019;ve passed down to you through the ages and the patterns that you observe in them. Appreciate the diversity around you and educate yourself and others about rights. We are oversaturated with information that digresses us from the things we need to focus on. The ice caps are melting; but it&#x2019;s the Kardashians that make it to the headlines. To not be a cog in this global suicide machine; we need to think; think instead of trapping ourselves and letting our lives be a mere simulation. We don&#x2019;t want that conspiracy theory to turn out true; do we? </p>, <strong><em>SANIA ANSARI                                                                          B.A.(Hons.)

On this glorious occasion the <strong>Hon&#x2019;ble Vice Chancellor; Prof. Najma Akhtar</strong> appealed to all students and staff members to put their best efforts in making Jamia better and reach the pinnacle of success in every regard. <br>During the celebrations in the <strong>Talimi Mela</strong>; the VC announced the opening of four new departments in the University namely<strong>  &#x2013; Design and Innovation; Hospital Management and Elder Care; Environmental Sciences and Foreign Languages</strong>. She further added that the University is planning to put Jamia Millia Islamia on the national map in respect of <strong>Environmental Studies and Climate Action</strong> and apart from the four proposed departments; the University is also planning to start a Medical College-cum-Hospital in the University Campus. She also said that the <strong>Prime Minister Narendra Modi</strong> has assured her of all the assistance in this regard and has further sent his best regards in this respect. </p><p>Just after taking charge as the Vice Chancellor our Hon&#x2019;ble VC promised on focusing on new courses and enhanced curriculum in the University; while showing interest in collaborations with other institutions for research related courses.<br>Earlier this year; four new courses were also initiated in the university which included <strong>Master of Science in Banking and Financial Analytics</strong> under the Department of Economics; <strong>M.Tech in Environmental Science and Engineering</strong>. Other courses included were <strong>PG Diploma in Molecular Diagnostics </strong>and an<strong> Advanced Diploma in Turkish Language.</strong><br>Several short term <strong>Entrepreneurship Development Programmes (EDP) </strong>were also introduced by the <strong>Centre for Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship (CIE)</strong>; in collaboration with the <strong>National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC).  </strong>In the previous session JMI had introduced a three year professional course in <strong>B.Sc (Aeronautics) </strong>in collaboration with <strong>Pawan Hans Limited (PHL)</strong>. It is a unique dual degree course with a graduation degree awarded by the University and a certificate in &#x2018;Aircraft Maintenance Engineering&#x2019; issued by the <strong>Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)</strong>. The course is a grand success; running in its second year; with a good feedback flooding in from the students.   </p><p>While talking to some students of the University; interestingly we found that most of the students find this move of opening new professional courses; a progressive one; some said</p><p>On the other hand many students argue that the University should first focus on improving the existing departments and courses and then think of opening new departments; in this regard the VC had promised that she would replace; update and modernize certain old courses and sought the best for the students. <br>I personally believe that the administration should improve the infrastructure of the existing departments and provide them with the essential facilities which should include a separate library for every department; regular workshops and seminars related to their subjects and a Placement &amp; Internship Cell along with that the University should open new departments and courses for both professional and research related studies; but more emphasis should be given on opening &#x2018;regular&#x2019; courses rather than &#x2018;self-finance&#x2019; ones which will help the financially weak students to pursue quality education in the university. </p><p><br> As someone once said; &#x201C;Our future is always coming up with surprises for us;&#x201D; these new surprises should definitely help the students and take Jamia Millia Islamia on the path of excellence.</p>, <strong><em>SAHIL KAZMI</em></strong>                                                                                  <strong><em>Bachelors of Business Administration &#x2013; IInd Year; Jamia Millia Islamia</em></strong>, Normal, 14/11/2019

Candle Light Vigil for Fathima & Dr. Singh, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/20191120_214708_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p>15 November; 2019; Students of Department of Mathematics; Jamia Millia Islamia held a candle light vigil in remembrance of mathematician Vashishtha Narayan Singh; who passed away this Thursday in Patna; Bihar.<br>Known as the mathematician who challenged Einstien&#x2019;s theory; Mr Singh; a resident of Basantpur in Bhojpur district; was shifted to PMCH Patna; last month with prolonged illness. However; he was discharged. On Thursday; he was brought to the hospital after his condition worsened. Doctors declared him dead on arrival.<br> Known for giving Vector Cyclic Theory; Mr Singh joined the Washington University as an associate professor after completing his PhD. He later worked at NASA and then returned to India in 1974 to teach at Indian Institute of Technology; Kanpur. After eight months; he joined Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); Bombay. In 1973; he was appointed as a faculty at the Indian Statistical Institute; Kolkata. He faced many difficulties during his life due to his mental illness. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. In 1987; he returned to his village Basantpur. He was lost during his train journey to Pune in 1989 and was found four years later in 1993 in Doriganj; near Chhapra of Saran district.  In 2014; he was appointed as a visiting professor at the Bhupendra Narayan Mandal University (BNMU) in Madhepura. </p><p>His death has triggered a row on social media as his family members were forced to wait for an ambulance outside Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH); with his body on a stretcher. Students were disheartened by this treatment of such a prominent mathematician and they marched silently in grief with candles in their hand from the Central Canteen to Gate No.-7. <br> The silence of this march was observed parallel to another march organised by AISA JMI demanding justice for Fatima Latheef. Latheef ; a 19 year old first- year student from Indian Institute of Technology; Madras;  allegedly committed suicide at her hostel last Saturday.<br> Holding posters saying: Justice for Fatima; they marched from Central Canteen to Gate No.-7 of the university. A native of Kerela; Lateef was pursuing her first year master&#x2019;s in development studies integrated at IIT-M.  While police said that no suicide note was recovered from her room; a note in her mobile had mentioned some faculty names as the cause of her death.  Abdul Latheef; the father of the deceased; alleged that Fatima was being harassed because she was a Muslim. <br> DMK President M.K. Stallin expressed shock  and grief over the suicide. &#x2018;It is extremely shocking that Fatima had committed suicide due to discrimination. Allegations of Fatima&#x2019;s mother has cast a cloud on the secular credentials of Tamil Nadu. This is a worrying trend. This is a shame;&#x201D; the DMK leader said in a statement while adding that it is time we avoid saffronisation of educational institution.</p><p>In the protest led by All India Students Association (AISA); students raised slogans calling for the arrest of the professors named in the note. With candles in their hands; the students raised slogans such as; &#x2018;Islamaphobia nahi chalega&#x2019;; (Islamophobia won&#x2019;t be accepted) and &#x2018;Minority pe hamla nahi sahenge&#x2019;; (attacks on minorities won&#x2019;t be tolerated.) Fatima&#x2019;s alleged suicide brought back memories of Rohit Vemula and Muthukrishnan. Students who were part of the march said &#x2018;it is shameful that such things are happening in the institutes all around India. We have seen how in the name of identity; and for being a Dalit; PhD scholar Rohit Vemula from Hyderabad Central University was forced to commit suicide. These are not suicides; these are institutional murders and this won&#x2019;t be accepted.&#x2019; They demanded that swift actions be taken against the culprits.</p>, <strong><em>MD SAEMUL HAQUE NOORI; BA (HONS) ENGLISH; JAMIA MILLIA ISLAMIA</em></strong>, Normal, 20/11/2019 
State and the Fourth Estate: Perfect Bedfellows, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/20191119_082032_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em>Media plays a crucial role in politics as it influences public opinion and helps define and take up the issues. It can keep the powerful in check and bring transparency in actions. But what if the media engages in a contractual liason and compromises with its capability and responsibility of holding the state accountable? </em></p><p>Media- the perfect spouse to Indian Politics has been a cardinal part of government&#x2019;s ruling for ages and for very long had a voice and role in the political diction of the country as well as the federal units. </p><p>But over the course of history; we do realize that media has always been the submissive while the government enjoyed dominance over the press; tracing this we head back to 1782 colonial India when the first newspaper; Hicky&#x2019;s Bengal Gazette witnessed an abolishment solely because of its criticism of the East India Company and faltering for the adulation for the company appropriately dictates the position of the two in the larger context; it further mantains it&#x2019;s positional relevance in 21st Century India with the only change being in the feasibility of compromise. Now; the media is found quoting a valid price for itself and whosoever pays the cost finds the patronage easily. </p><p>The General Elections of 2014; witnessed the tagline(s); &#x201C;<em><strong>Abki baar Modi Sarkaar</strong></em>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<em><strong>Ache din</strong></em>&#x201D;; and undoubtedly we fell to this trend and paved way for what we endure till now. Media; clearly had an undeniable role in BJP&#x2019;s win of 2014 and again stressed for it in 2019; the support of media continuing relentlessly has only treads of growth and no veritable stopping that could be seen as of now. This clearly shows the power that media encompasses; and is surely more powerful than any army could ever be. They can create opinions; they can change opinions; they can create sentiments; they can create realities. The media has the power to literally change societies and surely does that inevitably. </p><p>But; how does the current media exercise such power(s) ? <br> Used as a propaganda machine; the media today most certainly seems to lack the principle of objective and impartial reporting. Many major organisations unabashedly pick one side of the political spectrum (the one in power is always right) and at best provides relatively biased coverage or at worse act like the salesman for a particular political party.</p><p>The credits for the long-simmering crisis of credibility in the Indian media; also goes to the journalists holding the green sign for the ruling government. In an era of fake news and declining faith in media; an enfeebled class of journalists could eventually lead to the death of the very democracy that defines modern India. A fairly recent example is of November 2016; when Modi government abruptly recalled 86 per cent of the country&#x2019;s currency &#x2013; to fight corruption and media; following the rulebook failed to ask crucial questions or hold it responsible for the economic backlash.By initially lauding what most economists refered as a dangerous move and by buying the government line; journalists contributed in spreading the perception that phony economics could solve big problems and in the end; India&#x2019;s growth rate dropped for several quarters.</p><p>Considering another example; Modi government has substantially changed how the government calculates its growth data. In an open letter written to the PMO last March; more than a hundred economists and social scientists expressed concerns regarding India&#x2019;s statistical machinery that was being &#x201C;controlled by favourable political considerations&#x201D;. And again; Indian media barely covered the letter&#x2019;s release; let alone the double dealing data behind the government&#x2019;s magnificent growth proclamations.</p><p>In each of these cases &#x2013; especially the country&#x2019;s &#x201C;INFLUENTIAL&#x201D; TV channels &#x2013; functioned largely as government mouthpieces. Within the mainstream there continues to be honourable exceptions like that of New Delhi Television ( NDTV) or The Hindu that soldier on despite the pressures.</p><p>It&#x2019;s about time we realize that this dysfunctional relationship is harming the country&#x2019;s democratic status and is surely questionable on moral grounds (if it is considered at all; for it is just a political humour in today&#x2019;s time). Being the fourth-estate; media holds some serious  responsibilities towards its seekers and it should not sabotage its authenticity for such substandard relationship with the government.</p>, <strong><em>NUZHAT KHAN; B.

New Age Atheism: A Bourgeoisie Tendency, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/20190813_081620_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><br><strong>New age atheists</strong> are undoubtedly materialist: the revelation of modern science- mostly natural science- as they quote in their assertion. And also because it makes no sense to be an idealist and an atheist at the same time. The problem with them is that they ignore the historicity of this materialism. They claim that their body is made up of matter and they are an evolved creature but they gives no attention to the historical setting under which this material body evolved. Can we imagine ourself to have evolved in isolation without a society? Do history support it? I claim the answer to be negative. Human history informs us rather about what <strong>Foucolt</strong> calls <strong>&#x2018;bio-history&#x2019;.</strong> It means that the evolution of the body at a certain stage coincided with the society-formation. It is saving primitive communism when  we say that in all human society there have been classes which struggled against each other. It is in this background that <strong>Karl Marx </strong>asserted that <strong><em>&#x201C;the history of hitherto existing society is the story of class-struggle.&#x201D; </em></strong>What this long explanation aims at is very simple: A materialist must see the class struggle that goes on. To put it differently; an atheist must see the class struggle that goes on. Lets move one more step ahead: The societies are  characterized by a culture that echoes the interest of the dominant class. Also; these societies  hint at a rather unique phenomena which is the very basis of materialism:  The ideas; thoughts and concept of every class is the result of the material condition that they belong to. Having said this; I think the new age atheists do not  give adequate consideration to the class-based idea of religion among people. They openly criticize religion but do not realize that the proletarian view of religion and the bourgeoisie view of religion is different. Where Proletarians&#x2019; view it as a<strong><em> &#x2018;hope in hopelessness&#x2019;</em></strong> and  a <strong><em>&#x2018;sigh in the backdrop of oppression&#x2019;</em></strong>; the capitalists view it as a faculty of  legitimacy for their capitalist economic enterprise because it lays special attention to charity. Here; the new-age atheist fails to recognise the link between capital and religion. Religion is used by the bourgeoisie to maintain their dominance because on one hand they exploit people by their capitalistic enterprises and on the other hand do charity to withhold any criticism. The prolertariats are ignorant of any natural sciences given their material deprivations. They do not know any thing about science. In such a context; an open war on religion will only add up to the fanaticism of religion on part of the poor people- the working class. This is exactly why; as mentioned above;<strong><em>&#x201C;atheism without Marxism is incomplete and inconsistent&#x201D;</em></strong>.  The new age atheists&#x2019; approach is wrong. They should criticize capitalism more than religions. Simultaneously; they should press for the socio-economic upliftment as well as a scientific education for the poor because in this process they will learn about the contributions of modern science to be conscious of themselves- that is to say; to be a materialist or to be an atheist in the extreme cases. Claiming to be materialists; and ignoring the historicity of materialism is the greatest failure of  New Age Atheism.</p><p>All these said I shall now write about why I called new age atheism a bourgeoisie tendency. Firstly; I should say why I called it a tendency; not a movement. It is because it is incomplete and unrepresentative of the majority of people-  the working class. It is just a product of the leisure-hour-study of few countable people. To me; it is marxism that could be called a movement because it aims at both scientific explanation of the human history as well as the welfare of the people; not to mention it&#x2019;s high ideals of communist society. New Age Atheists on the other hand are only targeting the readable middle-class or bourgeoisie people. Even if they claim that they target the common people; it means nothing since they do not have the same tendency to criticize Capitalism- which is an actual solution to the problem. As to why I call it a &#x2018;<strong>Bourgeoisie</strong>&#x2018; rather than a &#x2018;<strong>Proletarian</strong>&#x2018; tendency can be explained by the same logic.</p><p>Just to add emphasis on what I have so far said; I cannot resist but say how many times does &#x2018;<strong>The Richard Dawkins Foundation&#x2019;</strong>; orchestrated seminars on the the relationship between Capitalism and religion. For how many times; did <strong>Sam Harris</strong> demonized Capitalism as opposed to religion; particularly Islam? Why does a life-long leftist <strong>Christopher Hitchen</strong> became a votary of Iraq invasion narrative of U.S; despite knowing that it was out and out a capitalistic venture of U.S to appropriate the resources of Iraq? The deficiency of proper answer to these questions is sufficient to hold strongly as to what I have attempted to show as the weakness of the &#x2018;<strong>New Age Atheists</strong>&#x2018;. They are by and large liberal and; in most cases; as much sympathetic to capitalism as they are inconsistently against religions.</p>, &#x2013;<strong>Ali Ahmed Sabir</strong><br><strong><em>Department of History; Jamia Millia Islamia</em></strong>, Normal, 13/08/2019

The present is due to be uncovered by the Vice Chancellor of the institute; Professor <strong>Najma Akhtar</strong>; as a part of 15th August celebrations. <br> The model that will be displayed in a glass scabbard out in the open. And hopefully will spark interest in the students to join the defence forces.</p>, Report : <strong>Narhitya Nawal</strong><br>Picture Courtesy : <strong>Kasim Ansari</strong>, Normal, 14/08/2019 
Castro Cafe Refuses to fill Boy’s Bottle; Boy Loses His Marbles, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/20190901_204324_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p>We have 8 years and 6 months in our Carbon Budget. That means if we keep going on at the rate we are right now; we will finish up all our carbon within 8 years and 6 months. July 31 was our Carbon Offshoot day. That means on the 31<sup>st</sup>&#xA0;of July this year; we used up all the Carbon we were supposed to use this year. We only have 4 months left; and the fact that it just took us 8 was admirable. That is not true. We have 8 and a half years before everything starts slowing down and it sets off the cycle that will probably end up in the Third World War. Worried about the Immigrants now? You&#x2019;re in luck &#x2014; as more and more countries literally go under the ocean and become inhabitable; we&#x2019;ll have more and more people piling up at the border; trying to survive; trying to find their luck in nations that are already struggling; literally because our previous generations; our own parents; finished up most of the resources we had. But in this moment; everything feels alright because the March update of Windows 10 lets your file explorer be black in colour. </p><p>As far as I remember; <strong>Jamia</strong> is a <strong>Central University</strong> and<strong> Fidel Castro</strong> was a die-hard pro poor Communist; at least he was supposed to be. With that historical precedent set; let me set the scene for you here: it is a hot afternoon in late July; in what is probably the hottest year the Earth has seen ever &#x2014; for a few days; it got so hot in France that the cores of Nuclear Plants couldn&#x2019;t be cooled and they had to shut the reactors down; and in this heat I was sitting inside the <strong>Castro Caf&#xE9;</strong> &#x2014; or; Uth Caf&#xE9;; depending upon how big of a nerd you are &#x2014; with a friend. She had to take her medicines after her meal; and I; being a true keyboard warrior for Environmental Causes; was carrying my faithful Borosil flask (you&#x2019;ll be missed; Ludwig) with me. She decided to use the water in my flask to take her medicine; and when I took it out I realised it was empty. The next course of action; despite her insistence upon buying a bottle of water; was to get my flask filled. I find the inherent premise of buying water bottles flawed due to its simple economics: the more you buy bottles of water; the more you increase the demand for plastics in the larger market and the more the demand is; the more the supply is. Therefore; I prefer to carry a bottle everywhere; which is not recommendable when you walk into the almost five-star restaurant in Haveli Dharampura in Jama Masjid because they will look at you like you&#x2019;re some hippy who refuses to understand how &#x201C;<strong><em>normal society</em></strong>&#x201D; works. </p><p>Once I came across a backpack on the internet that was made completely out of Jute. It was a <strong>Woodland bag</strong>; and it&#x2019;s USP was that it was &#x2018;<em>environment friendly</em>&#x2019; which was obviously them trying to get privileged nerds like me to come to their website; and the moment the link opened I was not disappointed. The price tag read 2000. And for the next hour; my roommates saw me launch into a rant and unravel like a horse that has been let loose somewhere in the high plains of Mongolia; or in other words; I lost my [word redacted]. They&#x2019;d seen me smugly complain; but they hadn&#x2019;t seen me be this; this is the part of me that throbs with anxiety whenever I take an auto and try to calculate how much Carbon I&#x2019;m going to use up and how I&#x2019;m going to be the messenger of the doomsday. On that day they realised how much a human being can biologically smugly complain. Capitalism; I said in a haze; was appropriating the Environmental cause. It has bought the whole conservationism thing and made it so inaccessible to people they would not even be interested. A leather backpack in today&#x2019;s day and age <em>1500 ki aati hai</em>&#xA0;and it&#x2019;s stylish and mature (it&#x2019;s actually a 1000; that guy was robbing you or something) and you have to pay 2000 rupees; a good 2.5% of my father&#x2019;s monthly income to be environmentally conscious. The cost of production wouldn&#x2019;t even be 300 rupees. It&#x2019;s Jute. I&#x2019;ve been around enough Jute. I know how it works. The fact that this bag; or even organic products in the market are so expensive ends up damaging the conservation cause. If it&#x2019;s so expensive people are forced to eat and breathe and wear what is being produced on <strong>Henry Ford&#x2019;s</strong> beloved conveyor belt and that comes at the cost; and that cost is that forests the size of <strong>Great Britain</strong> have been cut off the <strong>Amazon Rainforest</strong> and a cloud the size of the whole <strong>European Union </strong>is hovering over <strong>Russia</strong> because there are wildfires in Siberia. It makes it interesting; arguing in favour of the Environment in Public; because that&#x2019;s when you see people around you unravel; because none of us are willing to let go of our privileges &#x2014; our <strong>Olas</strong> and our <strong>Ubers</strong> and our Air Conditioning because it&#x2019;s going to kill the Earth. When people around you unravel; you see for yourself how they&#x2019;re willing to sacrifice everything because they have to hold on to their privilege. It&#x2019;s like seeing the orchestra still playing while the Titanic plunges into the cold waters of the Atlantic; people are aboard a planet that&#x2019;s going to be all water in a few years and they still find an hour under an Air Conditioner more convenient. There&#x2019;s something really unsettling about this; and people all around are too ignorant to even care. </p><p>Anyway; enough with the moral preaching and back to the story; because you&#x2019;ve probably skipped the last paragraph because it was too long. </p><p>So; I went to the water cooler at the backside to fill it up and I found the taps on the water cooler in disuse; and I tried pressing them till the base of my palm hurt to no avail. So the next option was to ask them to fill the bottle; which they have multiple times beforehand. I went to the counter; and I was refused flat out. They said they didn&#x2019;t have water to fill my bottle up with. </p><p>The nerve. </p><p>I have been refused in this manner by many people in Delhi; mostly shopkeepers; but I didn&#x2019;t expect this in a Canteen inside the premises of a Public University. Drinking water is a universal right and not even a Five-Star Hotel can deny you this right for free. The question of morality doesn&#x2019;t arise here; because it&#x2019;s a question of legality. They couldn&#x2019;t refuse me. So; out of all options and with a friend who needed to have their medicine immediately; I had no option but to buy a 10 rupee bottle of water and take it to her. I was enraged in that moment. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do. If they didn&#x2019;t have drinking water in that moment; there are two possibilities that arise here: </p><p>1. They actually didn&#x2019;t have water; which means everything we eat or drink at Castro that requires water is made out of water that cannot be consumed. </p><p>2. They refused to give me water because they wanted me to buy it from them. </p><p>Both the arguments here are problematic; the first one more openly so. If they didn&#x2019;t have potable water; what did they do when they were thirsty or what water is my Fresh Lime being made in? The second one here; works in a more skewed since because our privilege allows us to buy a 10 rupee bottle of water; but it becomes problematic when you look at it from the Environmental point of view: by buying that one bottle of water; you&#x2019;re increasing your own consumption of plastic; and as a consequence; your own carbon footprint. Now you might be making an exception; but in the macroeconomic sense; you&#x2019;re another blip on the graph. For the seller; you are <em>one sale</em>; and for the company you&#x2019;re another bottle sold and so on and so forth. Upon these numbers the demand for a certain commodity; in this case a bottle of water; will be evaluated and the budget given to bottles will be decided accordingly; which means you&#x2019;re one bottle more; and consequently; a little more plastic. It&#x2019;s simple economic behaviour; which becomes problematic because the agenda is being pushed; and there is more pressure on governments to accept plastic and that plastic ends up inside; say; the <strong>Porto Cervo whale</strong>; who had <strong>22 lb.</strong> plastic inside her when she washed up and died; pregnant. <strong>Coca Cola</strong> and <strong>Pepsico</strong> have officially left the Plastics lobby; but they didn&#x2019;t let go of plastics. Companies like <strong>Exxon</strong> and <strong>Shell</strong> knew about the damage they were doing to the Earth in 1980; which amounts to 40 years now. And still; for a positive figure at the end of the economic year; they decide to push forward their agenda; completely ignorant; to this date; about what they are doing to the resources of the Earth and other species that have a right as equal as ours to exist. </p><p>What worries me even more is what it means for the ideological space of the University: capitalism; is on the rise. All of our canteens; JMI bakers excluded; keep bottles of <strong>Kinley</strong>; which is directly under <strong>Coca-Cola</strong>. It is just to increase one more bottle sale that the man at the counter refused to fill my flask up. Remember the paragraph I wasted talking about the Woodland bag? That&#x2019;s where that steps in. The cause ultimately has its roots in capitalism. It is blatant capitalism in a space that is supposed to be equal in its treatment to everyone; a space where the poorest of the poor can get an education; and a good one at that. My privilege allowed me to buy the bottle; somebody might not be able to do that. </p><p>Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. </p>, <strong>-Srajit M Kumar<br> <em>Department of History and Culture; JMI</em></strong>, Normal, 01/09/2019 
Plotting Tales of Partition: Friction that Fuels the Fiction, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/20190815_112816_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p>Where<strong> W.H. Auden&#x2019;s</strong> Cynical evaluation of <strong>Sir Cyril Radcliffe&#x2019;s </strong>division of British India into Independent dominions- India and the nascent state of Pakistan; inspired him for his 1966 poem &#x2018;Partition&#x2019;; the great political upheaval propounded many other profound works. Poetries of <strong>Faiz</strong> and <strong>Agyeya</strong>; Stories by <strong>Manto</strong> and <strong>Chughtai</strong>; Paintings by <strong>Satish Gujral</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Engineer</strong><em> </em>have vividly encapsulated this great cataclysm; which triggered one of the most violent and devastating massacres of human history and an enduring acrimony between the two nations.</p><p>With almost a quarter of total human population; the two countries share a resonating relation with each other; which has been under continual surveillance over the years; with such presence on the international sphere and critical political mechanisms interplaying; matters as sensitive as partition require a very measured; careful and sometimes chary approach.</p><p>Like the Russian and French Revolution; throughout the Indian Freedom Struggle literature played a crucial role in unifying the nation together; but after the division literature had a different character to enact; with more varied demographics and much agitated nerves; the new literature as <strong>Priyamvada</strong><em> </em><strong>Gopal</strong> calls it; <strong>&#x2018;<em>Partition Literature</em>&#x2019;</strong> needed to correspond to things differently.</p><p>Although there&#x2019;s no consensus on what actually determines a work as partition literature; the accounts that narrativize this impudent historic event could be referred as partition literature.Irrespective of the fact that the narrative is a work of fiction or non-fiction; almost every work has shown &#x2018;partition&#x2019; in a negative light.</p><p>Where works like<em> </em><strong>Dr. Rajendra Prasad&#x2019;s</strong><em> India Divided; The Other Side of Silence by </em><strong>Urvashi Butalia</strong><em>; </em><strong>Nisid Hajari&#x2019;s</strong><em> Midnight&#x2019;s Furies or </em><strong>TCA Raghavan&#x2019;s</strong><em> The People Next Door: The Curious History of India&#x2019;s Relations with Pakistan </em>narrate the incident under the purview of Non-Fiction; ample work of fiction provide the description of the event through varied perceptions.</p><p>Dressing the partition of India in fiction was perhaps one of the most difficult tasks as a writer; from occupying the void created by political turmoil to filling it with imaginary settings; detailed characters and a storyline which accommodates multiple emotions and sentiments judiciously is a mammoth task.</p><p>Celebrated diplomat &amp; author of <em>The Great Indian Novel</em>; <strong>Shashi Tharoor</strong> says;<br> <em>&#x201C;Fiction reaches path of readers that other kinds of books don&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Partition of India provided the base for many prominent fictional narratives that substantially fulfill all the aforementioned aspects skillfully in an unprecedented manner.</p><p>The first book of this lineage has to be the 1981 Man Booker Prize Winner <strong>Salman Rushdie&#x2019;s</strong> epitome of magical Realism &#x2018;<strong><em>Midnight&#x2019;s Children</em></strong>&#x2019;; narrated by the protagonist <em>Saleem Sinai </em>himself who is born at the midnight of Independence; <em>Saleem</em> is compared with India itself. With his telepathic powers; he unravels the domain of cultural; linguistic and religious diversities; and further extends to a jarring note on Indira Gandhis&#x2019; &#x2018;Emergency&#x2019;. Rushdie&#x2019;s <strong><em>&#x2018;Shame&#x2019; (1983)</em></strong> is another phantasmagoric epic about an artificial country which is and is not Pakistan simultaneously.</p><p>It is followed by one of the most appropriate novels in this context; <strong>Khushwant Singhs&#x2019;</strong> 1956 retelling &#x2018;<strong><em>Train to Pakistan</em></strong>&#x2019;; which talks about the Muslim Sikh unity in the fictional village of <em>Mano Majra</em>; the story exemplifies how communal tensions develop in an otherwise peaceful setting.</p><p>The 1988 publication <strong><em>The Shadow Lines</em></strong> by <strong>Amitav Ghosh</strong> is a paradigm of Ghosh&#x2019;s intense narrative; capturing style and subtle characters that echo the pangs of partition in the psychological urn.</p><p><strong>Mukul Kesavan&#x2019;s</strong> <em><strong>Looking Through Glass</strong></em> explores the possibilities of aversion of Partition through a young photographers&#x2019; eye in 1942 British India and the tumult of Hindu Muslim riots in 1947. The story provides a fresh perspective with harsh political commentary and sexual comedy to compliment.</p><p>Stories by <strong>Saadat Hasan Manto</strong> are unarguably the most realistic descriptions of the horrors of partition; endowed with the faculty of sympathy and understanding Manto&#x2019;s stories like <em><strong>Colder than Ice</strong></em>; <strong><em>The Return </em></strong>or<strong><em> Toba Tek Singh</em> </strong>provide a picturesque like no other writer.</p><p>The exodus and the subsequent aftermaths of division have also been captured on celluloid adroitly. Beginning with <strong>Yash Chopra&#x2019;s</strong> directorial venture <em><strong>Dharmaputra</strong></em>; the 1961 feature film is based on <strong>Acharya Chatursen&#x2019;s</strong> novel of the same name and deals with the religious bigotry; fanaticism and communalism against the backdrop of partition.</p><p>In 1973;<strong> M.S. Sathyu&#x2019;s</strong> Debut feature <em><strong>Garm Hawa</strong></em> raised questions regarding the differentiation of an integral population and the dilemma that the protagonist <em>Saleem Mirzai</em> faces like many others; based on <strong>Ismat Chugtai&#x2019;s</strong> unpublished story; the movie earned several accolades to its name.</p><p>The cinematic adaptation of <strong>Bhisham Sahni&#x2019;s</strong> <em><strong>Tamas</strong></em> continues to be one of the longest movies of Indian Cinema; starring <em>Deepa Mehta</em> and <em>Om Puri</em> in lead roles it revolves around an immigrant family during the Rawalpindi riots of 1947.</p><p>The second film of <strong>Deepa Mehta&#x2019;s</strong> <em><strong>Elements Trilogy</strong></em>; the<em> Nandita Das- Aamir Khan</em> starrer <strong>1947 Earth (1998)</strong> is based on <strong>Bapsi Sidhwa&#x2019;s</strong> &#x2018;<em><strong>Ice Candy Man</strong></em>&#x2019;; where a Parsi family is caught in the communal tensions between the Hindus and the Muslims; in the city of Lahore.</p><p>The 2003 period drama <strong><em>Pinjar</em></strong>; is based on <strong>Amrita Pritam&#x2019;s</strong> novel of the same name where an ensemble cast comprising <em>Manoj Bajpayee; Urmila Matondkar</em>; <em>Sanjay Suri</em> and <em>Isha</em> <em>Koppikar</em> is shown to struggle against Hindu Muslim probe of partition.</p><p><em>Irrfan Khan; Tisca Chopra</em> starrer <strong>Qissa (2015</strong>) continues to be a popular citation among critiques; where a Punjabi man&#x2019;s desire for a son against the backdrop of partition provides a different angle to the historicity of the event;<em><strong> Viceroy&#x2019;s House (2017) </strong></em>by <strong>Gurrinder Chadha</strong> is a new entry on this list.</p><p>While it&#x2019;s been Seventy two years of Independence and the tragedy of partition; the narratives provided in these stories have continued to preserve the essence of this great political schism which has great social; mental and emotional implication on the lives of millions of people; fiction as always will continue to exert its presence in every significant account of history.</p>, <strong>Md.

Heroes of the no man’s land, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/20190815_132341_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p>I am a bit of a history buff and a loud-mouth about the fact that I could never pass by a building in Jamia without reminiscing an anecdote in the university&#x2019;s context. Late Historian and Ex-Vice Chancellor<strong> Prof. Mushirul Hasan</strong> has been extremely vocal about the fact; that the university has painstakingly dedicated each of it&#x2019;s building after a person; who was either a member of the freedom struggle or has offered service to the nation by serving in Jamia. </p><p>The walls of Jamia talk of freedom fighters; educationists and cultural icons; which makes taking a stroll in the campus equivalent to turning pages of History. Jamia; is quite the microcosm of the city where it is based and shifted to its modest quarters in <strong>Karol Bagh in 1925</strong>. Delhi apart from being quadrilingual; is a city that houses within itself numerous stories that await recognition and perusal. It is a city that names its lanes after the people it wants us to remember. History is recorded on Delhi&#x2019;s walls; much like Jamia itself. </p><p> As the last of those who have been eye-witnesses of partition fade away; it has become a fad to distort history to project it as what propaganda wants it to be&#x2014; because until the lion learns how to write; every story will glorify the hunter; which is why this is the time to; reclaim our past.</p><p>Seventy-two years ago; a minute apart from one another; two nations came into existence who were else united under a common oppressor; who shared the same struggles; the same names as their pioneers of freedom and equal zeal for Independence; until Independence actually came in 1947 with a collateral damage; and with it many such pioneers of freedom that the two nations shared disappeared from the pages of history.</p><p> Indians remember the freedom struggle every year on the 15th of August which came to us; as a contribution of our celebrated leaders and our unsung heroes; the ones that are less talked about; the names our history books haven&#x2019;t been generous enough in highlighting; Whether they be <strong>Ashraf Ali Thanawi</strong>; <strong>Abdul Qayyum Ansari </strong>or <strong>Fazle Haq Khairabadi</strong> who recorded an entire mathnavi on the walls of cellular jail; while serving his sentence for protesting against the British Raj. </p><p>The names that were lost within the pages of history books during the long struggle for freedom; those who have not found their due respect in India or across the border are &#x2013; The Heroes of the No Man&#x2019;s Land. Jamia is that no man&#x2019;s land; and these pioneers of freedom still walk here.</p><p>The institution has tried to preserve the memory of female revolutionaries like <strong>Begum Hazrat Mahal;</strong> <strong>Aruna Asaf Ali </strong>and <strong>Bi-Amma</strong>; who was the first Muslim woman to address a political gathering while wearing a Burqa andso was the mother of <strong>Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar</strong>; after whom the road in front of the University Campus is named. </p><p> It is no secret that Jamia is the lusty child of the non-cooperation days and the entire Khilafat movement manifested this university&#x2014; few revolutionary teachers found that they had significant differences with the administration of the MAO College that was predominantly British by that time; and would not lift the ban on their students participating in the<strong> Khilafat movement</strong>.</p><p><strong>Mahatama Gandhi&#x2019;s</strong> genius lay in the fact; that he could take the freedom struggle from door to door and connect the larger freedom movement to everyone&#x2019;s day to day problems. He had a gift that allowed him to connect every subaltern revolt to the freedom movement. The caliphate became the link between the <strong>Indian Islamic community</strong> and <strong>the movement of Independence</strong>.<br> Before Jamia&#x2019;s foundation; <strong>Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari</strong>; led a Medical Mission to Turkey to help the ottoman soldiers wounded in the <strong>Balkan wars</strong>; detailed accounts of which are found  in his correspondence with another Jamia founder; <strong>Maulana Mohammed Ali Jauhar</strong>.</p><p>However; the sympathies Indian Muslims had with the caliphate were not without a basis. After the <strong>1857 sepoy mutiny </strong>was quelled; the British administration came after its perpetrators; which included several Muslim names; many times these Indian Muslims were forced to flee from the British administration; and at the conjunction of the two great empires&#x2014; the ottoman caliphate and the British Empire; as <strong>Seema Alavi</strong> writes in her book <strong>Muslim Cosmopolitanism in the Age of the Empire</strong>;<strong><em> &#x201C;a new Muslim network was born in the aftermath of 1857&#x2014;buttressed by European empires; yet resolutely opposed to them&#x201D;. </em></strong></p><p>One such personality from Alavi&#x2019;s book is <strong>Haji Imdadullah Makki</strong>; whose disciples have been constructive in the creation of Jamia and the freedom struggle in general; directly or indirectly. These networks had made the dissipation of knowledge in the Muslim world easier&#x2014; as printed books began to be available and widely read by the Muslim community everywhere in the world which led to the prevalence of a pan-Islamic culture. The fall of the caliphate would mean severing of these lines and connectivity. Hence in 1920; <strong>Maulana Mohammed Ali Jauhar led his Khilafat delegation to England</strong>; to represent the interests of Indian Muslims; who did benefit from these networks rightfully. </p><p>The greatest contribution of the Khilafat movement was that; it brought the Western educated Muslims and the Ulemas together reconciling their differences and it was on this confluence <strong>Jamia Millia Islamia</strong> was born.  The foundation stone was laid by <strong>Sheikh-ul-Hind Maulana Mehmud-ul-Hasan</strong>; the silk conspiracy revolutionary; on<strong> October 29;1920</strong> at Aligarh whose memory is commemorated in the form of a Gate; which is now the entrance to the Jamia School; the oldest standing building of the present campus that underwent restoration works under <strong>Professor S.M. Akhtar</strong>. </p><p>Since its inception; Jamia has always stood for the co-existence of Islamic values along with secularism and the institution echoes its founding committee member <strong>Hussain Ahmad Madani&#x2019;s</strong> thought process; who believed that it was possible to be a nationalist and patriotic towards one&#x2019;s nation; while being a good Muslim; in fact he identified it to be rather necessary. </p><p>However; the struggle for freedom of the elders associated with Jamia did not end with the Khilafat movement. Maulana Mohammed Ali Jauhar&#x2019;s zest for freedom was commendable considering times when he was in British custody and two of his daughters; aged 20 and 21 fell ill. It was said that the British urged Muhammad Ali to apologise for his views; so that he could be allowed to visit his dying daughters; but surprisingly he refused to apologize to the Britishers. <br> He spoke at the First Round Table Conference held in London in 1930 and these were his exact words-</p><p><strong>On 4th January 1931; he passed away in London</strong>; remaining true to his words; and owning up to his vow in which he said; <em><strong>&#x201C;We must have in us the will to die for the birth of India as a free and united nation.&#x201D; </strong></em>His word was honoured and he was given a resting place in <strong>Jerusalem; Palestine near Masjid-e-Aqsa after a pompous procession. </strong></p><p>While <strong>Zakir Hussain&#x2019;s mausoleum</strong> within the university premises; designed by <strong>Habib Rehman</strong>; is a constant reminder of his contributions to the institution; and rightly so because <strong>Zakir Hussain Sahib has remained to Jamia what Nehru was to the nation&#x2014; the architect of a modern institution; he built the institution from the ground; brick by brick and tear by tear. </strong>Founders of Jamia Millia Islamia; who had served the cause of the freedom struggle and our nation by serving the institution; like <strong>Hakim Ajmal Khan</strong>; lie forgotten in obsolete graves. <strong>Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari</strong>; on the other hand who has a road dedicated in his honour in Delhi; lies in his desolate grave in Jamia and so does <strong>Aapa Jaan Gerda Philipsborn</strong>; the German Educationist who wished to be buried within the premises of the university. Unfortunately; these graves although situated in the university premises have been abandoned by students and teachers alike. </p><p> Jamia has had a long history; and by being a part of this aberration in the time space continuum; that is Jamia you are contributing to the pages of history. Being a part of Jamia; is like being a part of its heritage; of its <strong>ganga-jamuni tehzeeb</strong>; which must be sought to preserve; else it would loose it&#x2019;s ethnicity. And; if we don&#x2019;t; who else will? It is our responsibility; to remember the revolutionaries who laid their entire lives down struggling for the freedom of India&#x2014; who lived and died as Indians. Here; walls have eyes and ears.

Gulzar – The Man; the Poet, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/20190828_131415_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p>On the 25th of August; <strong>Delhi Poetry Festival</strong> in association with the <strong>Oxford Bookstore</strong>; presented a musing evening brooding over the doyen of Urdu Poetry &#x2014; <strong>Gulzar</strong> at The Oxford Bookstore; Connaught Place; New Delhi. The jam-packed audience came together to witness an interactive session with author; critic; translator &amp; an acclaimed aficionado of Gulzar&#x2019;s poetry<strong> Dr. Saba Mahmood Bashir</strong> on &#x2018;<strong><em>Gulzar &#x2013; The Man; The Poet&#x2019;.</em></strong> As<strong> Dolly Singh</strong> hosted the author of &#x2018;<em>I Swallowed the Moon: The Poetry of Gulzar</em>&#x2018; Dr. Bashir; they talked about the man and his artistic sensibilities which are finely crafted in his enthralling Poetry. His sprawling career sustaining as one of the leading <em>&#x2018;film-poets</em>&#x2018;; as she likes to refer it needs no introduction; but it was his non-film poetry that was talked with greater emphasis especially his three line &#x2018;Trivenis&#x2019;; that are said to be inspired from the Sangam of Ganga; Yamuna &amp; Saraswati. As Dr. Bashir reads few of his works she even discusses the imagery and poetic devices that he uses extensively with his imaginative brilliance and the high regard for moon in most of his poems. She also talks about the inspiration for his poems &amp; hails Tagore and Ghalib as few of Gulzar Sasaan icons; his directorial venture the television series &#x2018;Mirza Ghalib&#x2019; is referred as his tribute to the great poet. According to her; </p><p> As she based her judgement of the man as simple &amp; humble; she recalls him as a man of wisdom who works like a government clerk; reading and writing religiously. </p><p>The man who has numerous poems; films &amp; songs to his canon; Gulzar has directed many critically acclaimed movies like <em>Maachis</em>; <em>Ijazat</em>; <em>Angoor &amp; Aandhi</em>. With <em>Aandhi</em> being reviewed in detail in Dr. Bashir&#x2019;s latest release &#x2018;<strong>Gulzar&#x2019;s Aandhi</strong>&#x2018;; it is an insight on Gulzar&#x2019;s&#x2019;is cinematic marvel; the powerful political drama was a huge success and it&#x2019;s melodious music album penned by Gulzar is another major attraction of the movie. With &#x2018;<em>Tere Bina Zindagi Se</em>&#x2018; from the movie itself moved the entire audience in retrospection. Other songs like &#x2018;<em>Tujhse Naraz Nahi Zindagi</em>&#x2018; from &#x2018;<em>Masoom</em>&#x2018; and &#x2018;<em>Ek Akela is Shaher Mein</em>&#x2018; from &#x2018;<em>Gharaonda</em>&#x2018; and &#x2018;<em>Saathiya&#x2019;s</em>&#x2018; title track moved the evening in a different vibrance. </p><p> With an engaging question answer session from the audience marked the poets popularity among ages; it was certainly their love for Gulzar Saab that kept the evening going and was brought to end with the melodious rendition of &#x2018;<em>Ae Zindagi Gale Laga Le</em>&#x2018; from &#x2018;<em>Sadma</em>&#x2018;. It was indeed an enlightening session on Gulzar saab cherished by everyone with equal love &amp; devotion as his songs &amp; poems. </p>, <strong>Md. Faizan Salik<br><em> B.A Hons.

Twenty-Four Hours, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/20190906_183939_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p>It was 6pm by the clock; the sky was almost dark with clouds when Maya entered her home with a tired face. <em>&#x201C;Why do you look so dreary?&#x201D;</em> Maya&#x2019;s mother asked. Reluctant to reply; she threw her bag away and jumped onto bed with eyes closed. <em>&#x201C;Maa; seniors also say the same; first year of the college is boring and tiring.&#x201D; &#x201C;Your generation;&#x201D; </em>derisively spoke Maa; <em>&#x201C;gets bored of everything so easily. You guys don&#x2019;t want a life but a horse race!&#x201D;</em> Indifferent to this she stayed quiet with her hands covering her face. The successive hours were passed by her with light music; scrolling of Instagram and Facebook followed by dinner around 11pm. It was 11:55pm when the first phone call rang making Maya smile as it was her best friend; Mansi&#x2019;s; to wish her on her 19th birthday.</p><p><em>&#x201C;Happy Birthday darling! How are you? I&#x2019;ll be reaching your place tomorrow morning to give you birthday bumps!&#x201D;</em> said Mansi. <em>&#x201C;Thank you so much; I&#x2019;m good buddy&#x201D; </em>replied Maya; <em>&#x201C;don&#x2019;t trouble yourself early; we&#x2019;re meeting at 9pm tomorrow at The Rodger&#x2019;s. Hey; what about the dress; suggest me something!&#x201D;</em> To this without any delay; Mansi exclaimed; <em>&#x201C;Birthday girl go for a red one-piece; I&#x2019;m wearing blue.&#x201D; </em>And so their telephonic conversation went on for 5-7 minutes which was followed by Meenakshi&#x2019;s; Rahul&#x2019;s; Sana&#x2019;s; Priya&#x2019;s and Zainab&#x2019;s call. Her dispirited; exhausting day was negated by the cherry of the night; which was carried further to the morning by her mother kissing her forehead for her girl turned 19; and also by her father and two brothers. The sun was beaming as if it too wanted to come down and wish the girl on her day!</p><p>She decided to call it a day from college and prepare for the party with all the hair-spas; pedicures and manicures. And finally; clock struck the advent 8:30pm when she got into a cab and headed towards The Rodger&#x2019;s. On the entrance gate; in front of a huge blue light; were her friends who yelled <em>&#x201C;Happy Birthday Maya&#x201D;</em> and came to give her hugs and kisses filled with warmth. This vote of friendship turned into &#xE9;clat for the next hours during their gala where Maya was seen highly jocund. Around 11:55pm the time to bid adieu dropped in and all the friends parted in their respective directions. Due to some technical glitch in Maya&#x2019;s mobile network she decided to walk till the cab was booked.</p><p>On being engrossed in her device; she failed to observe the silence of the empty road. As she had come a long way from the populated street; an aberrant and vile laughter scared her so much so that her heart started to thump like drumbeats and her blood was rushing in veins and arteries like people running in streets out of hysteria. She dared not look back but collected all her strength to do the same as on such a frightful occasion her mind could not process any other way out. The sight as expected was dreadful as she saw three boys: one with an iron chain in the hand; another with wine bottle and the other staring at her with an assaultive expression hung about his face.</p><p><em> &#x201C;The last time my mind articulated a thought; Sir; was to run but it rectified itself by stating how far can you go Maya with these beasts hungry for their food? Then; one of them held me with firm hands by the waist and the other covered my mouth with his hand like bonkers. I shouted to seek help; I shouted&#x2026;but those screams were voice-less!&#x201D;</em> The police officer continued to question but not a word came out of her mouth; tears rolled down her cheeks which had deadly marks of being hit and her plaintive silence marked the end of the police investigations. </p><p>She stood up and went into her room without a word and was without food since her party. There was a dreadful air spread all over the house: the rest of the family cried for their loss as well as for their kid ready to die without a word. Her father knocked the door twice and thrice every 30minutes but was she even there no one knew! Yes; she was there; with grim and gloomy; dark eyes staring at her own reflection in the mirror. She wiped the incessant river flowing down the cheeks and spoke to herself; <em>&#x201D;Maa; it was your daughter&#x2019;s 19th birthday; her last birthday of a happy and healthy life or should I call it a death-day as who used to laugh and jump around the house hugging you each time she needed anything; has died. My deepest sympathies with you Maa; I wish I could smile and look into your eyes once again to pay condolence on your loss. See how nature works Maa; on one night you were jolly in merriment as she had grown up a year older and stronger to play mischief with you and on the other; you are sunken in tears for your child lost that every inch of smile and every phoneme of speech. Earth&#x2019;s one rotation brings in the light and dark; what a co-incidence; its one rotation made your kid also experience the light and the dark&#x2026;life changed; everything changed Maa; in just 24 hours!&#x201D;</em></p><p>The next morning the door of her room was broken to reach her but the pain intensified with the sight of Maya dead! The police again inquired; <em>&#x201C;was it a suicide?&#x201D; </em>This time it was the doctor who answered; <em>&#x201C;A 24 hour&#x2019;s overwhelming mental depression!&#x201D; </em>After listening to the fatal remark made by the doctor the officer laid a hand of sympathy on her father&#x2019;s; saying; <em>&#x201C;What all can the nature make you see in just 24 hours!&#x201D;</em></p>, <strong>Alveera Choudhry<br><em>M.A English; Jamia Millia Islamia</em></strong>, Normal, 06/09/2019

Reviving the Art of Bamboo – An Initiative of Enactus JMI, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/20190613_131155_0000.png?w=880&h=312&crop=1, <p><strong>Enactus JMI</strong>; the non-profit organisation being run in the university as a chapter of the international Enactus community has found its way towards reviving bamboo art and promotion of its cultivation. The idea has been realised under the banner of Project <strong>&#x2018;Irtiqa&#x2019;.</strong> Functioning since October 2018; the project started with the utilisation of bamboo in the vicinity of Jamia Nagar. The primary idea was to use it as a means of providing a stable livelihood to the community of Sambhal artisans residing in Batla House. The skilled artisans could not find a potential market for their skills due to the high expense of raw material and lack of opportunities. Economic impediments of impoverished conditions also proved to be a hindrance for the same. Thus; Enactus JMI; acting on its motto of <em><strong>&#x2018;Socially Diligent&#x2019;;</strong></em> acted as a bridge and brought the products made by the community directly to the market. The products were also sold on the society&#x2019;s e-commerce website &#x2013; <strong>Enactus JMI Store </strong>where the handicrafts have met with enthusiasm from art lovers and those keen of artefacts.</p><p>The project is also aligned with the <strong>National Bamboo Mission</strong> functioning since 2006 across the country. The NBM&#x2019;s key objectives are to address issues relating to the development of the bamboo industry in the country; provide a new impetus and direction and enable the realisation of India&#x2019;s considerable potential in bamboo production.</p>, The students of Enactus JMI have worked with a holistic approach to curb the issues faced by the community; in turn uplifting the members and spreading awareness regarding the aspects of <strong>&#x2018;green building&#x2019;</strong> through the utilization of bamboo. Such student bodies; like &#x2018;Enactus JMI&#x2019; working towards the greater good of underprivileged communities and spreading the entrepreneurial spirit provide us with hope for the future., Normal, 13/06/2019

The Menace of Mob Lynching: Is it time to tailor a separate Anti-Lynching Legislation?﻿, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/20190407_103259_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p><em> </em><em>Over the past decade; the social and legal ethos of the Indian subcontinent is drifting towards doom. The degradation and degeneration of the legal fabric is brought about and fuelled by the frequent outbursts of rage by the self-appointed law-officers who resort to lynching people; in order to serve justice to them. This paper discusses the issue of mob lynching in detail; its history and background along with the need to have a separate anti-lynching legislation in the country. It provides a critical analysis of the current scenario of mob violence in India and also apprises the reader of how the existing legislations are not adequate to deal with the situation which we face today. </em><em></em></p><p>Against the backdrop of the unstoppable narrative of extremism and radicalism reverberating through the entire subcontinent in the form of mob violence; lynching and extra-judicial killings; this paper discusses the pressing need for incorporating a separate anti-lynching legislation in the statue books of the country. To do so; it first gives a brief background of the lynching in India in Part II. Knowing the background is important as it helps to contextualize the situation and paints a distinct outline of the entire scenario for the reader.</p><p>The paper deals with mainly two aspects. Firstly; it tells the reader why existing legislations would fail to address the problems perpetuated by the mob-lynchers. This is covered in Part III. In part IV; the paper talks about the United States of America; and how the situation there is quite similar to that in India; and how the United States is addressing this issue.</p><p>Part V concludes the paper by suggesting the measures that can be taken presently to deal with the menace of lynching. </p><p>&#xA0;2015. Dimapur; Nagaland: A mob of 8000 people breaks into a prison and drags out a man who has been detained under the suspicion of rape and makes him parade naked before finally beating him to death.</p><p>Also; in the past decade; India has seen a ruthless form of mob justice being practiced by people who resort to inciting violence among communities to satiate their personal interests. This has become a regular practice in India where men and women are lynched for their choices in food; or after a spat over an auto ride;&#xA0;or in some cases; even Whatsapp rumours.</p><p>Also; cow vigilantes have had a fundamental role to play in these lynchings and it is becoming increasingly necessary for the government to regulate and control the activities of such elements who otherwise would disturb the entire social and legal fabric of the country. It is being said that;&#x201D;India has been beset by a wave of gruesome lynchings. And at the epicentre of the country&#x2019;s violent upheaval is the indolent cow.&#x201D;</p><p>The term &#x201C;Mob Justice&#x201D; is gradually and unfortunately becoming a part of our daily lives.</p><p>The Indian Penal Code has provisions against unlawful assembly;&#xA0;rioting;&#xA0;and murder; but there is nothing in the code which exclusively identifies or punishes the offence of mob lynching. Though Section 223(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code deals with the offences committed in course of the &#x201C;same transaction&#x201D;&#xA0;and has provisions to prosecute the accused; but it fails to address the issue of mob lynching per se and hence is prone to be misused and took advantage of. </p><p>The counter-claim to this line of thought may be that there are already enough provisions to deal with the crime of mob lynching; and the enactment of such a legislation would be unnecessary as it would open the floodgates to a lot of cases which would burden the already pressurised and overworked judiciary. Relevant citations may include Murder;&#xA0;Attempt to Murder;&#xA0;Culpable Homicide not amounting to murder;&#xA0;and acts done by several persons in furtherance of a common intention.&#xA0;However; it is important to note; that neither of them apply to a situation in which a person is executed in frenzy by a group of people who believe that their acts are legal and justified.</p><p>The first three sections may not be the appropriate sections for the crime of mob violence as; &#x201C;<em>if a large crowd of persons armed with weapons assaults the intended victims; it may not be necessary that all of them have to take part in the actual assault</em>.&#x201D;&#xA0;The applicability of Section 34; IPC is discussed in part IV of the paper.<em></em></p><p>Hence; it would be a tough task for the courts to decide; which person should be tried for murder and which person should not be.</p><p>One of the first instances of lynching in the United States happened at St Louis in 1835. Consequently; in 1918; The Dyer Bill<sup>&#xA0;&#xA0;</sup>&#xA0;was introduced in the United States Congress which went on to influence the later anti-lynching legislations in the United States including the Costigan Wagner Bill. The Dyer Bill&#xA0;provided for the following:</p><p>&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;To assure to persons within the jurisdiction of every State the equal protection of the laws; and to punish the crime of lynching. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled; That the phrase &#x2018;mob or riotous assemblage;&#x2019; when used in this act; shall mean an assemblage composed of three or more persons acting in concert for the purpose of depriving any person of his life without authority of law as a punishment for or to prevent the commission of some actual or supposed public offense.&#x201D;</em><em></em></p><p>The United States has till date not been able to enact an anti-lynching legislation having failed over 240 times in the past 100 years.The United States Senate agrees and apologises for having failed to enact an anti-lynching legislation;and over 100 years from when the congress first tried to pass an anti-lynching legislation; senators in the United States are trying again.</p><p>Here; it is important to note that The United States already has United States Code &#x2013; <strong>Conspiracy Against Rights &#x2013; </strong><strong>Section 241</strong>&#xA0;which states;</p><p><em>&#x201C;If &#xA0;two or more persons conspire to injure; oppress; threaten; or intimidate any person in any State; Territory; Commonwealth; Possession; or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States; or because of his having so exercised the same&#x2026;They shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years; or both; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap; aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse; or an attempt to kill; they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life; or both; or may be sentenced to death.&#x201D;</em><em></em></p><p>It although does not mention the word; &#x201C;Lynch&#x201D; but defines the crime in its entirety and imposes strict punishments on the offender.</p><p>Hence; the conditions prevailing in India and in the United States; are similar. Both have existing legislations which deal with issues which adumbrate the idea of punishing lynchers but do not have a specific law to deal with it. Also the fact; that the United States is actively pursuing &#xA0;the formation of an Anti-Lynching legislation gives India all the more reason to do so; keeping in view the similar situations prevailing in both the countries.</p><p>The fundamental aim to enact an anti-lynching legislation is to make the existing statues and existing legislations; more comprehensive and wholesome. If an action to this effect is taken; the first and foremost thing that would happen is that all the mob lynching cases would come under a specific and named category. They wouldn&#x2019;t have to be tried under separate clauses of separate legislations.</p><p>Moreover; if a separate legislation is enacted; it would give the courts; the legislative power to take decisions regarding mob lynching. They would not have to try each person individually and investigate whether he/she has any defence to his/her actions under the law of the land.</p><p>&#xA0;There can never be an end to the menace of Mob-lynching; unless there is a separate legislation to deal with it. One of the reasons also being; that the existence of a legislation which exclusively deals with a particular type of crime instills a sense of fear in the offender; which in turn may dissuade him from committing the offence. </p><p>It is therefore concluded by this paper that in the interest of the country; and in a wider sense; the society as a whole; it is necessary for the government to tailor a separate legislation; or at least add a clause to Section 34 of the IPC which; firstly describes as to what a mob is; and secondly attaches violence; as an essential element of the crime of lynching and explicitly spells out penalties for the persons involved in the same. Before; a detailed separate legislation comes into force; the Indian Penal Code could be amended to incorporate the following as <strong>Section 34(2).</strong><strong></strong></p><p><strong>&#x201C;</strong><strong><em><strong><em>In furtherance of the common intention; if the group of persons; form a mob; and resort to violence or lynching or an attempt to commit the same; they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life; or both; or may be sentenced to death.&#x201D;</em></strong></em></strong><strong><em><strong><em></em></strong></em></strong></p><p>The clause would work as a buffer until a separate and detailed legislation is drafted; which has a separate definition clause for the offences stated above; and other extent and jurisdictional clauses; so that law and order is restored in a society which is otherwise at the risk of drifting towards anarchy and barbarism.</p>, <strong> -Tanishk Goyal<br> <em>National Law University; Kolkata</em></strong>, Normal, 07/04/2019 
Film Review-  ‘Period. End of Sentence.’, https://tjrexpress.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/20190421_145536_0000.png?w=851&h=312&crop=1, <p>As the title of this short 26 minutes duration documentary suggests; the movie talks about <strong>&#x201C;Period. End of Sentence.&#x201D;</strong> It talks about how menstruation is still believed to be a taboo in India and that it should never be a cause for women to not soar high. Yes; the documentary is very inspiring and hence has won the <strong>Oscars 2019 for &#x2018;Best Short Documentary&#x2019;.  </strong></p><p><br> The documentary is shot in a village of <strong>Hapur District</strong>; which is 60km from Delhi. The movie starts with two girls shying away when asked about period. It shows how even speaking about period make the girls feel uncomfortable. The awareness about menstrual cycle and its hygiene is still not up to mark in the rural areas of India and hence there is a lot to change still. The documentary tries to capture the problems faced by the rural women when they are on their cycle. Getting period is a big reason in itself for the women folk to be a drop out from school. Disposing of pads even made them feel ashamed and moreover the stigma of menstruation persisted largely. The reasons of period are still unknown to them and the documentary reveals the age old patriarchal mind set where the male members of the community turn a deaf ear towards menstruation calling it a woman&#x2019;s disease. Thus; even in an environment of ingrained stigma of menstruation the documentary features how women strive and work hard to become financially more independent so that empowerment speaks in itself for them.</p><p><br> The documentary introduces to its viewers characters like <strong>Sneha; Rekha ; Shabana</strong> and others from the village who become the flag bearers for women of the village and have the spirit to empower themselves. Sneha who aspires to join the Delhi Police is an active character in the documentary and she wants to soar high with freedom.</p><p><br> The film introduces <strong>Arunachalam Muruganantham; </strong>a social activist from <strong>Coimbatore;</strong> whose intentions are to make India a 100% sanitary napkin using country. The movie &#x201C;Pad man&#x201D;; <strong>Akshay Kumar</strong> starrer was inspired by him and it was he who set up the first affordable pad making machine. As per him;<em><strong> &#x201C;Everybody knows it; but no one wants to talk about it.&#x201D; </strong></em>This particular statement justifies the title of this award winning documentary completely. As the installation of a pad machine begins in the village; the women acknowledge the use of sanitary napkins/pads and become aware that there is a thing called &#x2018;pad&#x2019; which can replace the age old practise of using cloth during their cycle; further giving them hygiene; comfort and relief from shame and uneasiness. Further; the women of the village find their source of income by this small scale activity in the village and even initiate a marketing campaign for the sale of &#x2018;fly&#x2019; pads.</p><p><br> The film further justifies its title by using the technique of narrative in an efficient manner. The hesitation of the women to talk about period in front of the camera was well taken care of by the director <strong>Rayka Zehtabchi</strong> and the narrative voices were heard throughout the documentary without getting the subjects in front of the camera unless they were comfortable; was even remarkable. This is how the documentary pictured the problem faced by the woman even today in India in a short duration efficiently.</p><p><br> The entrepreneurial skills of the woman have been pictured really well in the documentary which tells the viewers that their passion is unstoppable. The making of pads have not only earned them an income but also have given wings to their ambition. <strong>Sneha</strong>; one of the characters in the film; is funding her training for Delhi Police through the wages she is earning from the pad machine. The installation of pad machines were funded by the students of <strong>Oakwood School in Los Angeles</strong> and these machines brought about a significant change in the lives of the women in the village enlightening them on their way to freedom.</p><p><br> Thus; period is period. And it ends there. It has nothing to do absolutely with the independence or education of women. Patriarchy and age old beliefs are still so ingrained in Indian society that seeing period as a taboo is nothing more than a myth. Its simple biology that people need to understand and for that reason more awareness on menstrual cycle; its hygiene and affordable sanitary napkins would definitely make a revolution in the rural areas ; thus making a shift from being called as a taboo to just simply terming it as <strong>&#x201C;Period. End of Sentence.&#x201D;</strong></p>, <strong>-SONALI PATNAIK                                                           <em>M.Phil. 2nd Year; CJNS; JMI.</em></strong>, Normal, 21/04/2019
